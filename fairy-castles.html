<p>Once two friends were strolling down the street. It was a daily walk
they took together.</p>
<p>They passed a nice house of yellow brick.</p>
<p>One said, “That is a nice house. The brick is yellow; it reminds me
of what I believe they call London Stock Brick.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the other.</p>
<p>They kept walking. They came to an empty block, overgrown with
weeds.</p>
<p>The other said, “Now that’s a nice fairy castle!”</p>
<p>The first hesitated, and said, “Ahh …?”</p>
<p>“You know, right there,” said the other. “With the walls of
marshmallow, floating fourteen feet in the sky! Oh, and the rainbow
colored unicorns guarding the sapphire stairway are such a lovely
touch!”</p>
<p>“Ahh, hah,” said the first, catching on with the joke, “And the
goblins by the path there!”</p>
<p>The other stopped and turned to them, a serious expression on their
face. “There’s no goblins, what are you talking about? Are you taking
the micky?”</p>
<p>“No, I just … sorry I guess.”</p>
<p>They fell silent and walked on.</p>
<p>Just outside the first friend’s home, the other said as they parted,
“Just because you don’t see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t real. Did you ever
think whether brick houses are real?”</p>
<p>They parted, and the first entered their nice home. It was a warm,
comforting home, with sweet paintings on the wall and bright cushions on
the couch.</p>
<p>That night, the first friend couldn’t shake the feeling of worry.
What was up with their friend?</p>
<p>They tried searching online and what they found was worrying.</p>
<p>When they typed “fairy castles …” they got a series of auto-complete
suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>fairly castles are real</li>
<li>fairy castles are really made of marshmallow</li>
<li>fairy castles facts</li>
<li>why fairy castles are the best place to live</li>
</ul>
<p>There were thousands of videos, entertaining produced and brazenly
confident, explaining how fairy castles were built, what their history
was, and why their reality was suppressed.</p>
<p>There were plenty of explanations for why brick houses were not as
solid as you might think. After all, bricks were just atoms, and atoms
were just energies in space. On an atomic level, what’s the difference
between bricks and marshmallows? Physicists couldn’t even agree on the
fundamental interpretation of reality in quantum theory. How could they
so confidently say things like, “Castles can’t float?”</p>
<p>It was hard to find information arguing for the reality of brick
houses. People seemed to just take it for granted. It was strange, now
that they came to think of it: how could we just live in brick houses
all our lives and never wonder whether they are real? Media accounts
were careful to not alienate their audience, presenting both sides of
the argument with an even hand. Experts from the fairy castle community
spoke eloquently about the joys of soft diamond pillows and mermaid
ponds, while the “scientists” mostly gaped open-mouthed like fish.</p>
<p>The next day, the friend came by for a walk as usual. Off they went.
The other friend was excited.</p>
<p>“Oh, I can’t wait to see the fairy castle again! It will be surely
even more beautiful today!”</p>
<p>The first friend didn’t know what to say. They felt awkward. Normally
they were happy to walk together, but now it was weird. So they stayed
silent.</p>
<p>“Oh see,” said the other, “Now there’s even more fairy castles! They
are just springing up everywhere!”</p>
<p>But the first friend could not see. They turned away, tried to focus
on other things. But the other was just so happy, it really was as if
they were walking on sunshine.</p>
<p>During the walk, the first friend found themself tuning out more and
more from the other. They didn’t hear them, didn’t see them. They walked
in separate worlds, as it were. One followed the path of the sun, the
other the path of the moon.</p>
<p>When they arrived back home, the first friend turned to the other.
They meant to say something, to suggest that maybe they need not walk
together every day, that they preferred to just be quiet rather than to
listen about fairy castles all the time.</p>
<p>But to their surprise, the other was hardly there. They had faded and
become transparent. Their voice echoed as if from the bottom of a
distant well. And as the first friend watched, the other rippled in and
out of existence like a face under water. The world was splitting and
they could only watch in silent puzzlement.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done. The other was gone.</p>
<p>The first went back into their house. It was brick. Drab grey brick,
with bare walls and bars on the windows.</p>
<p>As they locked the door behind themself for the last time, they
wondered, “Did I ever have a friend?”</p>
