<p class="preamble">
This essay was presented by Bhante Sujato at a plenary session of the
Sakyadhita 2019 conference in Leura, NSW. Global warming is an
unprecedented threat to the survival of our civilization and culture,
indeed our very lives. The aboriginal myth of Gurrangatch and Mirragan
tells of a time when the land of the Blue Mountains was shaped in the
struggle for life, a struggle marked by both passion and restraint.
While the future has never been more uncertain, our wisdom traditions
offer us ways of talking about and responding to change as conscious
individuals able to reflect on and choose our own responses.
</p>
<p>
I want to bring something of my own land for you all today. The wisdom
of our indigenous peoples has been disparaged or neglected, and the cost
of that neglect is becoming ever clearer as our climate changes and
nature is decimated. They looked after this land for 50,000 years, and
we managed to stuff it up in a couple of hundred.
</p>
<p>
Around 1900 an ethnographer and surveyor named R.H. Mathews met with
Gundungurra people of the Burragorang Valley and recorded the creation
story of the serpent Gurrangatch and the hunter Mirragan; of how their
struggle shaped the rivers, hills, and valleys we know today as the Blue
Mountains.
</p>
<p>
I am not of the Gundungurra people, and this is not my story. Yet it is
my land; not in the sense of ownership, but of belonging and kinship. I
will never fully apprehend what it means to be one story with the land,
to have my song be the land‚Äôs song. I experience the story of
Gurrangatch and Mirragan not while walking the paths they forged in the
tale, sheltering under the mountains they built, and drinking from the
streams they swam, but via a constellation of interpreters and
technologies, removed and abstracted. I cannot tell you what this story
meant to the people who lived in this place. I can only say what it
means to me, offering their story for you today in a spirit of the
deepest respect for the Gundungurra people and their culture. This is a
story of the dawn; let us see what it has to say to those of us who live
in the twilight.
</p>
<p>
Follow the snakes from south to north to tell the story, and listen to
Aunty Val Mulcahy, an indigenous storyteller, speak it in her own words.

<h2>
<a id="Mythic_echoes_10"></a>Mythic echoes
</h2>
<p>
As always with deep myth, we can tease out many threads from this story.
It is a struggle between cosmic forces, an echo of the fires that shaped
the land in geological time. Gurrangatch is an incarnation of the
so-called ‚ÄúRainbow Serpent‚Äù who figures in countless Aboriginal creation
myths. The dragon or <em>nƒÅga</em> mythology, so fundamental to Buddhist
story and iconography, draws on the same set of mythic connotations, the
formless powerful serpent hiding in the depths of the earth. The suttas
speak of a serpent who glides along with fiery breath, manifesting a
rainbow of colors (SN 3.1). At Wat Saman Rattanaram in Chachoengsao this
has been brought to gloriously tacky life.
</p>
<p>

<p>
In the curious mythological Vammika Sutta (MN 23), the protagonist must
dig, dig, dig, and throw away all the odd things their digging reveals.
At the bottom of all lies the <em>nƒÅga</em>, but that is not to be
thrown away: it is the enlightened one, and must be honored and revered.
Here, the metaphorical road to enlightenment is not the ascent to higher
spiritual realms, but the unearthing of the layers of the unconscious.
The <em>nƒÅga</em> symbolizes the deepest layer of all, that which is to
be retained, not discarded.
</p>
<p>
Mirragan is the closest thing to a human protagonist in the story. He is
a ‚Äútiger cat‚Äù or ‚Äúquoll‚Äù, one of the many creatures that inhabit these
woods that are neither kangaroos nor koalas. These days quolls are quite
rare. Since the white man came, one species has become extinct and all
that remain are in decline and under threat.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
As a mammal, the quoll is quick on his feet, resourceful. Mirragan‚Äôs
technology and wiles‚Äîpoison, spear, club‚Äîovermatch Gurrangatch‚Äôs
primordial strength. He is passionate, proud, and capable, but his
obsession brings danger to himself and his kin. Only his wife speaks
words of moderation and wisdom. Heroes like Mirragan are remembered
because they are so very rare. Far more common are those who get
distracted along the way; or those who listen to the begging of the
wife, and give up the heroic quest for a smaller, more domestic
happiness. In this story, the wife plays the same role as Yasodhara; she
is the normal life, the life of contentment for those of us who are not
heroes. For every great myth that tells of leaving her behind, there are
a thousand tales of the one who gave up the quest; for who could blame
them?
</p>
<p>
But Mirragan‚Äôs true skill lies not in his persistence or his cunning,
but in forging alliances; sending an unmistakable message of the
importance of befriending others and maintaining relationships, it is
only after he brings in the birds that he can win. Their attack on
Gurrangatch, the birds of the air seeking out the chthonic monster of
the deeps, recalls the universal mythic struggle of the phoenix or
<em>garuda</em> versus the serpent or <em>nƒÅga</em>.
</p>
<h2>
<a id="Conscious_incorporation_24"></a>Conscious incorporation
</h2>
<p>
In all these motifs, and many more, there are points of interest,
lessons to be learned, wisdom to be gleaned. But it is one little detail
that strikes me most of all.
</p>
<p>
Just as the Vammika Sutta advises us to ‚Äúleave the dragon‚Äù, the
diver-bird fails to dislodge the monster. He contents himself with
gouging off a piece of the serpent‚Äôs meat. This they consume, taking the
serpent‚Äôs body into their own, becoming one in flesh. Mirragan, for all
his destructive obsession with slaying the beast, is content with just
this much.
</p>
<p>
In the Greek myths, Athena was a warrior maiden associated with the owl
for wisdom and the olive for cultivation and civilisation. Her sacred
olive has fruited in the Mediterranean region until the present, but
even the goddess cannot stay climate change: Italy faces a 57% drop in
olive harvest this
year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
Athena was a thoroughly modern goddess, suitable for a cosmopolitan and
sophisticated people. Among her many virtues, she aided heroes in their
conquest of the dragon. Here, with an owl in her hand, she presides as
Jason is released by the serpent who guarded the Golden Fleece.

<p>
Yet on her breast she wore, not a symbol of the beauty and virtue with
which she is associated, but something far more grotesque: the
decapitated head of the serpentine deity Medusa, who turned men to stone
with a glare. How she came by this gruesome relic is another story, but
the point is this: the new cannot completely leave behind the old.
</p>
<p>
What does it mean to become one flesh with the monster? It is an
acknowledgment that when we reform, we make progress in some ways, but
we also unconsciously incorporate the echoes or the dark side of what
has been reformed. We imagine that we are better, that we have
surmounted and are pure: <em>that</em> is our temptation, our conceit,
our precious.
</p>
<p>
How often have we seen reformers who, in no long time at all, become
worse than the thing they replaced? In the political sphere it happens
all the time. In reformist spiritual communities we can frequently see
the resurrection of hierarchies, the imposition of judgmental rules and
harsh standards, the assumption of ethical purity, the corruption of
wealth, fame, and reputation, and the manipulation of doctrine to serve
the interests of those in power. We must learn how dysfunctional
behaviours work in spiritual communities, so we may leave them behind.
We can only do that when we are equally conscious of the value of the
past, of what is genuinely sacred in our traditions, so that we can
preserve it and give it new life.
</p>
<p>
If we are just going to incorporate the flesh of the old in the new,
replaying the old patterns out again, it is tempting to think that
perhaps the chase is not worth it; maybe we should have listened to
Mirragan‚Äôs wife after all. Psychologically, however, incorporating part
of the old in the new is intrinsically healthy, an essential part of
growth. Like any developmental process, it can go awry, for sure. But
the new is not invented out of thin air. It must build on what came
before. Incorporating the old is an act of compassion: it shows a
connection between one and the other. It shows that, for all the
limitations of the old, it was, after all, just a system built by humans
who were trying to live. Yes, they made mistakes, and yes, we must do
better. But we too are human and we will make our own mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I learned a key lesson on the nature of tradition from the aboriginal
elder of the Nyoonga people, Ken Colbung. When I was only nineteen, I
helped put together a seminar on vegetarianism. Hearing that Ken was
vegetarian, I called him and asked if he would present with me, and he
graciously agreed. He explained that in his traditional belief, animals
were viewed as being brother or sister, so they would only be killed
when it was absolutely necessary. A hunter would apologize to the beast,
explaining that they needed to feed their family, and asking for
forgiveness. These days, he said, there is no need to kill; he can just
drive down to the market and buy some tofu!
</p>
<p>
This is what it means to have a living tradition. It is not a fossil
preserved in stone, but something organic and evolving; we reflect on
it, consider it, discuss it, improve it. We are aware of the ways in
which we are shaped by the past, for good and for bad, and we try to do
better. But awareness‚Äîreal, clear-eyed awareness‚Äîtakes guts.
</p>
<h2>
<a id="Deep_adaptation_48"></a>Deep adaptation
</h2>
<p>
With awareness and reflection comes choice. We do not have to be driven
by the agendas of the past, for their struggle is not our struggle. We
face new challenges, and for us, the greatest challenge is global
warming. If our morality is the morality of the past, if our
consciousness is the consciousness of the past, we choose to make
ourselves unfit for the future. Reforming Buddhism is great; creating
conscious spiritual communities is great; improving gender equity is
great: but none of it means anything if our entire ecosystem is headed
for collapse. In the face of the imminent existential threat of climate
catastrophe, all our moral priorities and agendas must be urgently
reconsidered.

<p>
Global warming is all around us and all through us. We incorporate the
flesh of change in the air that we breath, in the water we drink, it is
in our own flesh and bones. Look around you, see the mighty, endless
forests, that have lasted from the days of Mirragan and Gurrangatch.
Australia has, still, one of the fastest rates of forest clearance
anywhere in the world. This state, New South Wales, is one of the
world‚Äôs greatest coal-producing regions; and it is no coincidence that
the level of renewables in our electricity production is stuck at a
miserable 13%. Our politicians, incredibly, tell us that ‚Äúnow‚Äù is the
time for government to push the creation of new coal power
plants,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>
while fish die off in their millions, and still we don‚Äôt even have a
target for
renewables.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>
When you turn on the lights, you are killing those trees. They are dying
because of how we are living. The canopies are thinning, the seeds are
reducing, fire is increasing, and their ability to recover is
collapsing; so much so that even sober scientists say ‚Äúthe whole thing
is
unraveling‚Äù.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>
Species are becoming extinct before we even know they exist; Australia
is losing its frogs, which are especially vulnerable to changes in water
supply and
temperature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>
As Australia suffers through yet another year of record-breaking
temperatures, drought, fire, heat, and all manner of more obscure
changes are creating a hidden, invisible crisis to countless little
creatures of the
forest,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>
like the possums who are simply dropping dead from the trees from heat
stress.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>
It is not just on the land; in fact the vast majority of all the extra
heat on earth is in the oceans, which now suffer from ‚Äúheat waves‚Äù that
devastate forests of kelp and cities of
coral.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>
And as I write, the indigenous people of the Solomons face a black tide
of dead fish, unable to swim or to eat as their waters have been
poisoned by an oil
spill.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>
Meanwhile, the mining conglomerate Glencore has been busted sponsoring
covert operations to spread lies about
coal,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup>
and a deal has been signed for two massive new coal power stations, just
down the road from here in the Hunter
Valley.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>
How do they justify all this? Listen to the argument of Kepco, the South
Korean firm that wants to open a new coal mine in the Bylong Valley, not
far north of Joolundoo where Mirragan caught Gurrangatch. When the
courts stopped their development because of climate change impact, their
response was: <em>our</em> project will make a negligible contribution
to global warming. In the scheme of things, what‚Äôs an extra 200 million
tonnes of
CO2?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
One of the nice things about writing on global warming is that research
is super-easy. The articles I referenced in the previous paragraph were
chosen by a simple criteria: they appeared in the news during the three
or four days it took me to write this piece. That‚Äôs right: these stories
on global warming were all published between the 4th and the 7th of
March this year. Between then and now there will have been hundreds more
like them. This is the rate of change we face, and the depth of the
challenge.
</p>
<p>
The last form of denial is the denial of the activist: the idea that by
continuing to do the same things we have been doing for a generation,
<em>this</em> time it will make the difference. We sign our petitions,
choose our organic veggies, prefer renewable power. Meanwhile, the CO2
in the atmosphere keeps going up, and the temperatures keep rising.

<p>
This can be considered as a graph of the rise in global atmospheric CO2
since the post-war acceleration of industrialization. Alternatively, it
could be considered as a graph of the rise in global atmospheric CO2
since the beginning of the modern environmental movement. How can this
be? It is because the kinds of things that we do to prevent climate
change are already factored in. They are business as usual. And the net
result of all this effort is the world we are living in right now. If we
continue to do the same kinds of things, we will continue to fail.
</p>
<p>
Painting a compelling, detailed picture of the climate collapse that is
looming in the coming decades, Professor Jem Bendell speaks rather of
‚Äúdeep
adaptation‚Äù.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>
It is a questioning of the fundamental values and course of our lives,
facing honestly the emotional and spiritual stress of living in a world
that is coming to an end, and asking what life might be like after the
collapse.
</p>
<p>
Bendell discusses at some length the emotional ramifications of facing
up to climate catastrophe. We feel scared, confused, let down, even
risking plunging into despair and depression. Yet he points out that
despair is not universally seen as a bad thing. The great spiritual
traditions, including Buddhism, acknowledge that despair can be a spur
to deep introspection and transformation. Think of the crisis that
Siddhattha went through when he faced up to the reality of universal
death and suffering. There is a way out, but we will not find it through
denial or mollycoddling.
</p>
<p>
What then might we, drawing upon the best of our Buddhist traditions,
have to offer the world in this time of unprecedented crisis? We must
start by speaking the truth; and just this much is already a great deal.
Too many of us harbor our worries and fears in secret, unable to speak
them because, well, when is the right time to talk about the end of the
world? Far from bringing despair to people, many are already facing a
quiet despair. Even little children view the future through the lens of
apocalypse rather than utopia. Our Teacher has taught us that all things
are impermanent, that we should not hide from change, but should live
each day in awareness and compassion.

<p>
Perhaps the most powerful thing we have to offer is renunciation. The
joy of simplicity and contentment. The knowledge, learned from our own
experience, that with a simple life comes clarity and ease. Enough, as
Mirragan eventually came to learn, is enough. Too often renunciation is
seen as a purely monastic virtue, when it is there for everyone in Right
Thought of the Noble Eightfold Path. It will not be long before
renunciation is no longer a choice. Our children will have less than we,
and their children less still. Having less, consuming less, is the most
powerful way we can minimize the damage that we do, while also preparing
ourselves to cope with the changes that we cannot prevent.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I would point out once more the key to Mirragan‚Äôs success: he
worked with his friends. The Buddha said that good friendship is the
whole of the spiritual path, and creation of meaningful intentional
communities (Sangha) has always been a core aspect of his dispensation,
and through the Sangha, the Dhamma has survived for 2,500 years. In the
days to come, those who survive will not be the preppers or the
survivalists in their bunkers, or the billionares with their walled
estates and private armies. It will be the villagers and the
tribespeople. Those who know how to work together, to create local,
small-scale systems of work and exchange, who understand and respect the
land and the sky and the water, the beasts and the plants. These are
skills still found in Buddhist villages across Asia‚Äîperhaps we should
start learning from them.
</p>
<p>
Mirragan pursued his goal, ferociously and relentlessly. But he was
content to eat just a piece of flesh, leaving the great serpent-spirit
alive and safe in the depths. That is why they both survived, a living
presence in the landscape to this very day. We have shown no such
restraint, no such wisdom. We kill the serpent, poison his waters, and
wipe out his forests.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt come here to bring you hope. It‚Äôs too late for that. We don‚Äôt
need hope; what we need is courage. Stay close to each other, support
each other, live simply in the real world, and listen to the truth
whispered to you in the trees. Never be afraid to step forward and show
leadership to share your wisdom and compassion. As spiritual
practitioners, it is up to us to show honesty and realism, to set an
example of how it is possible to live in the face of radical change.
Impermanence is core to our philosophy: are ready to live it? This
world, this beautiful fragile world, needs you more than you know.
