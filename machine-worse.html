<p>machines make everything worse<br />
so we hide it away<br />
we hide it in the future<br />
we hide it in other places<br />
we bury it underground<br />
so we don‚Äôt see it<br />
and we don‚Äôt know it<br />
and we don‚Äôt care about it<br />
but it‚Äôs there<br />
and somehow<br />
it makes everything worse<br />
in smashing<br />
and in killing<br />
in degradation<br />
and pollution<br />
it all gets worse<br />
but it seems better<br />
if we don‚Äôt look too hard<br />
or think about<br />
what‚Äôs behind the door<br />
because there<br />
everything is worse<br />
it‚Äôs worse because we made it worse<br />
because of our machines<br />
our machines made it worse<br />
but don‚Äôt worry too much<br />
there is an answer<br />
and the answer is easy<br />
and the answer is waiting<br />
and the answer is ready to serve<br />
and the answer is always the same<br />
more machines<br />
better machines<br />
bigger machines<br />
so we build<br />
more machines<br />
better machines<br />
bigger machines<br />
and they just make everything worse<br />
and we have no other answer<br />
and we have forgotten what else we can do<br />
and we forgot that machines exist to serve us<br />
not we to serve machines<br />
so even when we know<br />
that machines make everything worse<br />
we go right ahead and build more machines<br />
because we believe them<br />
the makers of machines<br />
the masters and commanders<br />
they know<br />
they must<br />
they see further than us<br />
because they have more machines<br />
better machines<br />
bigger machines<br />
and if the machines do not fix the problem<br />
and if the machines do not solve the issue<br />
and if the machines do not repair the damage<br />
if they just make everything worse<br />
at least we can<br />
bow<br />
it feels good to bow<br />
it feels good to give in<br />
it feels good<br />
to let the machines fulfill their destiny<br />
to let the machines be greater<br />
and us lesser<br />
to worship them<br />
our new gods<br />
what did the old gods do for us anyway?<br />
let our souls be acid<br />
and our thoughts be fire<br />
and our veins be metal<br />
let us be worse<br />
because machines make everything worse<br />
or<br />
did it once happen that on the sandy shore<br />
with decayed plastic underfoot<br />
and the strewn nets of trawlers<br />
and the ickily warm grey waters<br />
oily and limp<br />
that it stuck in your bare foot<br />
ouch<br />
and you bent down and picked it up<br />
white with its fibonacci swirls<br />
a sea shell<br />
and you remembered<br />
so long ago a child<br />
and you put it to your ear<br />
