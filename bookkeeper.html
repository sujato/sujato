<p>A man walked into a shop. He went up to the counter and said, “I’d
like twelve bees, please.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, sir,” said the lady behind the counter. “And may I say,
an excellent choice.”</p>
<p>“It’s for my wife,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Well, she’s a lucky woman.”</p>
<p>“I … well”, he said. “Not really.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“This is an atonement of sorts.”</p>
<p>“An atonement?”</p>
<p>“You see, I have not always been like this. I was a bookkeeper. I
managed spreadsheets, every day. Make sure the right data is added, make
sure it all collates, clear up any confusion. Keeping track of other
people’s money.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honorable profession.”</p>
<p>“It is. Not the most exciting to be sure. But it was a reputable
company—Felix Bane Equity, maybe you’ve heard of them. I did a good
day’s work and went home to my lovely wife and two kids.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“You said ‘was’,” said the lady behind the counter. “Did something
happen?”</p>
<p>He laughed. “Did something happen? It did.</p>
<p>“We had a range of clients, as you do, but I had one client who took
up the biggest part of my portfolio. There was a lot of money moving in
and out. A lot. And always through these complicated mechanisms, in and
out of shell companies, crypto exchanges, the City. Nothing illegal, at
least not on our side. But you know. Not exactly legit either. Who he
was, we did not know. Everything was anonymous.</p>
<p>“Over time work for this client grew until I was assigned exclusively
to him. I would go into the office, sit at my spreadsheet and work
through the latest transactions. I’d get a coffee, chat with a
colleague, then immerse myself in high-end hotels, custom couture,
luxury yachts. Over time, the meaning of the payments became associated
with specific brands, with objects, times, and places. They started to
form memories and associations in my mind. Daydreaming, I guess, but
they became more than numbers; I could smell them.</p>
<p>“The work grew. Gradually the whole company ended up working on this
one account. But I was on it the longest, so they were working for me in
a way. It was good, the client was so rich, the company was making bank
just doing the books. Until one day, we heard that there was to be a
change in ownership. Nothing changed on our end, just our founders
retired and we had a new name listed as our owner.</p>
<p>“Not unusual, of course, but I knew that name. It was some
conglomerate. No different than a million others. But something about
it, the smell, tickled me. I looked it up, followed it through the maze
of shells, until it brought me back to the Client. We were auditing the
books for our new owner.</p>
<p>“Dodgy? No doubt. But we didn’t do anything different. To be honest,
I don’t think there was anything to it. I think there was just an
offshoot of a shell of a branch somewhere, and someone managing a
portfolio decided to buy this profitable accounting firm. They didn’t
even know.</p>
<p>“Nothing mattered to anyone. Except me. Now I knew.</p>
<p>“Each day I’d come to work, assign the tasks, do my job. I’d see my
colleagues, going on with their lives. I’d go home, kiss my wife, play
with my kids. It was easier than ever to be happy. But there was this …
split. Like I could be happy because I was watching myself drift, like a
balloon. Unmoored.</p>
<p>“The numbers became too heavily freighted. There was too much meaning
in them. They were like, pushing at the boundaries of their cells. I
began to fear that they’d escape.</p>
<p>“One day, I got up from my seat to make a coffee, and I just kept
walking. Out the door, down the street. I kept going.</p>
<p>“I saw things. Trees, children, cars. Nothing special. Not like the
fantasy world that I knew in my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>“I wandered into a shop. They made fish and chips. I smelled it and
walked out again.</p>
<p>“I wandered until night came. I grew tired. I ended up on a beach. It
was nice. I sat there, looking out at the sunset. It was warm and
still.</p>
<p>“It had been a hot day, and I didn’t like feeling sticky and smelly,
so I decided to go for a swim. I stripped naked—there was no-one
around—and dove in. It was lovely! I felt free and strong as I swam
out.</p>
<p>“I turned, and to my shock, the beach was gone. I’d swam further than
I thought. There must have been a rip. I didn’t know what to do. It was
dark and I felt afraid. I swam, but did not know the direction.</p>
<p>“I knew that I was in grave danger. This was it. It was almost like I
had come here for this. Looking back, it seemed as if my direction since
leaving the office had been right here. Like my feet had been
unconsciously leading me to this point and no further.</p>
<p>“I blacked out. But I didn’t drown, obviously.</p>
<p>“I came to in a medical station. White walls, medical equipment
around the place. I was dry, safe, in a bed with clean sheets. I was
wearing a gown. A nurse came in, smiled, and said, ‘You’re awake! Thank
goodness. We were all so worried for you.’</p>
<p>“‘Where am I,’ I asked.</p>
<p>“‘Don’t worry, you’re safe,’ she said. ‘You’re on a boat. We saw you
in the water. Or our owner did. He was on the deck, and just happened to
see you. You’re very lucky. We’re a long way out.’</p>
<p>“‘Oh,’ I said.</p>
<p>“‘When you’re ready, you’ll meet him. He’s anxious to hear your
story.’</p>
<p>“I was feeling okay, so I said, ‘I’d like to thank him.’</p>
<p>“‘Well,’ she said, ‘come.’</p>
<p>“I got up, feeling a bit self-conscious in my hospital gown. But the
nurse laughed, told me not to worry. She led me down a long corridor, up
an elevator, and along another corridor.</p>
<p>“‘How big is this boat?’ I asked.</p>
<p>“‘Big!’ she laughed. We came to a door. ‘Sir,’ she called.</p>
<p>“I went in. The owner got up to meet me. It was a sitting room, I
guess. High in the boat, with views out to the waters. He smiled and
took my hand. ‘So good that you’re okay!’ he said.</p>
<p>“I thanked him. He looked at me concerned and said, ‘Is everything
alright? You seem not all here. Here, sit down.’</p>
<p>“It was the strangest feeling. I knew this place. I had been here. Of
course, I had never been here, never anywhere even remotely like here.
But I knew it. Every surface, every smell. And this man, I knew him. He
was the Client. This was the world I had been living in every day, the
world inside my spreadsheet. And here it was, in polished mahogany, in
dewy bottles of champagne, in couches of soft leather. All these things
had come to be through the touch of my fingers.</p>
<p>“I told him my story, leaving nothing out. When I finished, I said,
‘I’m right, aren’t I? You are he?’</p>
<p>“He looked thoughtful. ‘I guess so,’ he said. We paused for a while
until he said, ‘Here, let’s get you some proper clothes.’</p>
<p>“He took me to his closet, filled with the most exclusive custom
tailoring, and invited me to take what I wanted. I picked some clothes.
They all fitted perfectly. He took me to a mirror, and said, ‘There, you
look great.’</p>
<p>“It was odd. We were different people. We didn’t look all that much
alike. But generically—mid-tall, medium build, white, brown hair with a
bit of grey—we weren’t that different. And standing beside him, my
savior and benefactor, in the mirror, it was almost like we were twins.
‘Perfect,’ he said.</p>
<p>“Then, to my astonishment, he started taking off his own clothes.
‘I’m sorry, what?’ I said. He said nothing. When he was stark naked, he
walked out on to the deck, and without hesitation, dove in to the
ocean.</p>
<p>“I was gobsmacked. What to do? I looked around me, panicking. Would
people think I pushed him? What was he doing?</p>
<p>“‘Help!’ I yelled. Right away, a butler opened the door.</p>
<p>“‘Yes sir?’ he said.</p>
<p>“‘The owner—he just jumped overboard!’</p>
<p>“‘I’m sorry, sir, what do you mean?’</p>
<p>“‘He just took off his clothes and jumped!’</p>
<p>“‘Ahh, I see, sir. Well, I guess this is some kind of game, but I’m
not sure how it is played.’</p>
<p>“‘Game? It’s no game.’</p>
<p>“‘Right you are sir. Well, since you have apparently jumped
overboard, my services will no longer be required for the night, I
assume. Have a good night, sir.’</p>
<p>“He closed the door, leaving me more confused than ever. I rushed out
of the room, but every time I spoke to one of the staff, they just
called me ‘sir’, until I realized the obvious: they thought I was him.
Nothing I could do would change their minds.</p>
<p>“I slowly came to realize that this must have been an out for our
Client. He must have been in some kind of trouble. Or maybe he had just
grown bored with his life, as I had with mine. Maybe he’d been looking
for an escape, and he saw me as some kind of doppelganger. I had left my
life behind, and I was intimately familiar with his. I knew all I needed
to know about his lifestyle, his preferences and tastes.</p>
<p>“Ruminating, I fell asleep on his large, circular bed. I woke to the
sun streaming through the windows and sparkling on the infinite sea. The
butler was back with a breakfast tray. Without looking, I knew exactly
what was on it. A tossed omelette, two eggs, with fresh-baked bread and
parsley on the side, a whole mango, a glass of fresh-squeezed mandarin
juice with sparkling water, and a dash of sriracha. And of course, a
strong black coffee.</p>
<p>“The butler served me silently, as if nothing were out of the
ordinary. I was hungry, so I played along. I had to admit, breakfast was
pretty delicious. Nothing like simple food done perfectly.</p>
<p>“Each moment it was as if I sank more deeply into the Client’s life.
I knew it was a lie, but was it though? He didn’t want his life, so why
not me.</p>
<p>“I enjoyed my day. Until as evening came, I got a call. A young woman
came on the screen. She was in her early twenties, and obviously excited
about something. ‘OMG dad! I got in!’</p>
<p>“‘I knew you would, sweetheart,’ I said.</p>
<p>“‘No money, no influence. They didn’t even know who I was. I just
gave them the application and they liked me!’</p>
<p>“‘I’m so happy for you, my darling. I know how important it is for
you to do your own work.’</p>
<p>“‘There’s a research grant opening up soon, and they say I should
apply. The whole department’s behind me.’</p>
<p>“I was truly happy for her. We chatted about this and that, about her
boyfriend, her new apartment. I was proud of her.</p>
<p>“And so it went. I slipped into his life like a second skin. I have
no idea why or how, but somehow I just knew everything that I needed to
know. It was like, this was the life I had been living all along, and my
old life seemed more like a dream.</p>
<p>“Now I was the one making the deals, ordering the transactions. And
someone in my old firm was keeping track of it all. I played in the best
casinos, stayed in the best hotels, ate the best food, and drank the
best wine. I met my daughter and hugged her and shook her boyfriends
hand. And I made love with my new wife. It was perfect.</p>
<p>“Just one small thing. I couldn’t quite stop thinking. Where had he
gone? I mean, he clearly made his choice, I felt no guilt. But did he
just … go? Did he drown? I mean, I assume so. But I didn’t really
know.</p>
<p>“I wondered whether he might make it to shore. Perhaps the rip
reversed itself, or we had drifted into another tidal pattern. If he
arrived there, with no clothes on. No life, no personhood. He might
collapse, exhausted but grateful, on the sandy beach, just as the dawn
was breaking. Taking the first breath of a new life.</p>
<p>“Early on the beach there are many eccentric people. Power walkers,
yoga circles, models doing photoshoots, men with metal detectors looking
for watches. And nudists. A naked man would be nothing strange. Maybe
he’d walk up from the beach, grab some clothes from the shower or
changing area, and walk on down the road. He would feel free for the
first time.</p>
<p>“Where would his feet lead him? Would he gaze in wonder at the
passing fancies? Would a mere traffic light or stubbed-out cigarette be
an object of fascination for him? </p>
<p>“Down nondescript roads, past generic shopfronts, through beige
suburbs, until he came to a house. Would he walk up to the front door
and knock? And when a woman answered, would he say, ‘I lost my
keys!’</p>
<p>“Would she squeal and embrace him, telling him how worried they all
were? Would she assume he’d had a fugue state, wandering aimlessly
overnight? And the next morning, after kissing his wife goodbye, would
he look forward to going to work, settling down to an ordinary, good
job. Taking care of my money?</p>
<p>“I have the resources, of course. I could easily get someone to find
out for me. But that wouldn’t feel right, you know?”</p>
<p>“I understand completely,” said the lady behind the counter. “Hence
the bees.”</p>
<p>“Hence the bees.”</p>
<p>Taking the box of bees from the shelf, she began counting them out.
“One. Two. Three. Four …”</p>
<p>“I know it must seem weird,” said the man.</p>
<p>“Not at all, sir,” said the lady behind the counter. “It’s more
common than you think.”</p>
<p>“I just need to know,” he said. “Once I know, I can settle it, go
back to my yacht.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure your wife will love it.”</p>
<p>“What? Her?” the man said. “Oh no, you misunderstand. I’m going back
to my yacht, but I won’t be taking her. My new wife is much better. I
just need to know.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said the lady behind the counter. “My apologies, I assumed …”
She continued counting. “Five. Six. Seven. Eight.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what will happen, though,” mused the man. “I mean, if he’s
there or if he’s not: which one is better? I guess in a way it’s better
if he is there; more symmetry.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, sir.” she said. “Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve.”</p>
<p>He thought, or imagined, a flicker behind her eyes. Like the studied
facade of unquestioning service had slipped for a second. “Listen, miss
…” checking her nametag, he said “Shesha. Who are you to judge me! I’m
just following my dream.”</p>
<p>“Of course, sir,” said the lady behind the counter. She caught his
eye, and slowly counted out an extra bee. “Thirteen.”</p>
<p>They stared right at each other in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>“But madam,” he said. “I paid for twelve bees.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, sir,” she said. “The last one is a freebie.”</p>
