<p>It was a nice day walking through the zoo with my friend and their
lovely children. Now, before we start, let me say, I am opposed to
keeping animals in captivity. But this was an open-range zoo, cruelty
free.</p>
<p>We visited the hyenas and the macaws, took in the little marsupial
mice and the hippos. Such fun!</p>
<p>Then we came to the tiger cage. It was a magnificent beast, a
full-grown Siberian tiger, as white as the snows of its native land.</p>
<p>“Aww, such a cute little puddy tat!” said my friend.</p>
<p>“Right!” I agreed. “Cuddly.”</p>
<p>We came near the fencing. The little children were so fascinated.</p>
<p>“Can we touch him?” they said.</p>
<p>“Ha ha, not a good idea,” I said. “Careful, he’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Come on, man, why are you scaring the kids?” said my friend. “He’s
not going to hurt anyone.”</p>
<p>“Sure, I mean, not so long as he’s in the cage and we’re out
here.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, tigers aren’t really that dangerous. Humans kill more of
them than they of us. And they only attack people if provoked.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but did you not see?” I said. “There’s a <em>literal red
flag</em> right there that says, ‘Beware maneater!’”</p>
<p>“Yeah sure, right,” laughed my friend. “They just put that for the
drama. Gives people a thrill.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, no I don’t think so,” I said. “The sign here says that this
tiger is a notorious maneater. It regularly hunted and ate humans for
years, singling them out as prey.”</p>
<p>“Look, don’t be reductive,’ said my friend. “Just because it eats
people doesn’t mean its a bad tiger. You can’t define it by its worst
impulses. Blame the sin, not the sinner.”</p>
<p>“So what, it’s a tiger that eats people, but we can’t call it a
people-eating tiger?” I asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>“You just asked me a question. Does that mean I can define you as a
question-asker? Is that all you are?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know what to say to that. But pretty sure it’s okay
to call a tiger a maneater if it, you know, eats men.”</p>
<p>“Why are you so against tigers?” said my friend. “You must really
have a thing, running this, like, anti-tiger crusade.”</p>
<p>“No my friend, just wanting to keep everyone safe,” I said. “The
tiger’s perfectly fine just where he is.”</p>
<p>“You might want to make everyone hate tigers,” said my friend. “but
they need love, too. Why do you think they got this way?”</p>
<p>“Lack of love?” I offered.</p>
<p>“Bloody right,” said my friend. “There can be more than one side to a
story, you know. Not everything is so black and white.”</p>
<p>“True, not everything. But you know what is black and white?” I
asked. “The stripes on that huge maneating tiger!”</p>
<p>Laughing, my friend said, “Hey kids, want to get closer?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes!’ they happily screamed.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if we can climb the fence!” said my friend.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, what?!”</p>
<p>“We’ll just pop in to pat it. It’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Do not do this! It’s a man-eating tiger, you’ll all be in incredible
danger!”</p>
<p>“God, you’re so negative, you know? Tigers are beautiful creatures,
why do you have to be so death and destruction all the time?”</p>
<p>“No, don’t go in there. Look, here it says this tiger chewed off a
man’s head.”</p>
<p>“Will you cut this violent language, you’re upsetting the children,”
said my friend. “Here kids, let me give you a leg up to the tiger
cage.”</p>
<p>Alerted by all the noise, the tiger had got up and was prowling
closer to the fence, licking its lips.</p>
<p>“Hey little puddy-tatty,” said my friend. “Can we pat you?”</p>
<p>It growled deep in its throat as the saliva dripped from its open
jaws.</p>
<p>“Aww, it’s purring,” said my friend. “He says yes, let’s go
kids.”</p>
<p>“No, stop!” I said, crying and screaming. “What are you doing?
Stop!”</p>
<p>“You know your problem? Always so emotional. Always judging others.
Why can’t you just stay positive?”</p>
<p>“Hey thanks for the life advice,” I said. “Let’s discuss it over
there <em>where there are no tigers</em>.”</p>
<p>“Lol, good try. Okay kids, one, two, three, and over we go!”</p>
<p>Laughing the little child leaped into the tiger den. In one mouthful,
it gobbled them up.</p>
<p>There was silence for a second. Then the other child started
screaming. “No, no, they ate them! They ate them!”</p>
<p>My friend looked at me, shocked. “Oh my god, how did you know?”</p>
<p>“Never mind that now, just come down,” I said.</p>
<p>“Hang on,” he said. “It must be a trick, right? A hologram or
something? I mean, there’s no way they could just let people waltz on in
here and get eaten, right?”</p>
<p>“There are signs everywhere! And you just climbed the fence!”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s a fake. No child gets eaten that quickly.” Decisive, he
said to his remaining child, “Your turn, don’t worry, it’ll be
fine.”</p>
<p>And over they went, and into the tiger’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” said my friend, “that’s really a cool trick. Hilarious
right?”</p>
<p>“No! Not hilarious! Your children just got eaten by a tiger!”</p>
<p>“Yeah right, you’re so gullible. Anyway, I’m next. Oo-hoo, I’m so
scared! Please don’t eat me, hologram tiger!”</p>
<p>He jumped. Maybe the tiger was full. Or maybe it just didn’t like the
smell. Anyway, he sniffed my friend disdainfully and sauntered off for a
nap, two children in its belly.</p>
<p>“Hey come on, eat me!” said my friend.</p>
<p>“I think he’s full,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be crazy, holograms can’t be full,” he said. “Now, where are
my kids? Kids! Hey! You can come out now!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re coming out,” I said.</p>
<p>“But why,” said my friend. “What happened? I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Just then, there was a crash and a glitch. Everything went black for
a second, then came into focus. A white room, a desk, two people sitting
with elaborate headsets on.</p>
<p>A man in a white coat said, “Okay, the simulation’s over. Take a
minute to adjust.”</p>
<p>“Wha- what?” I said hazily. “Oh, oh yes, okay, here we are.”</p>
<p>My friend was even more dazed than I. He was shaking his head,
looking around him, he seemed on the verge of panic.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey,” I said, “It’s okay. It’s a simulation, remember? We’re
doing beta testing for the new VR game.”</p>
<p>“Oh, oh god,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was intense, right?” I said. “Like, so immersive. It wasn’t
just the sensory stuff, it was the whole feel of it. You
<em>believed</em>.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said the technician proudly. “That’s the real breakthrough
here. We don’t just create a realistic fantasy on the outside, we create
it on the inside too. All your emotions, thoughts, values, beliefs,
they’re just as real to you in there as all this is to us out here.”</p>
<p>“Incredible,” I said. “But to be honest, it was pretty traumatic. I’m
not really seeing how it’s entertainment.”</p>
<p>He laughed and said, “Well sure, it’s not for everyone. But you’d be
surprised. A lot of people, in fact, believe that this world is just a
simulation. Hard to disprove, right? Who knows how far down the rabbit
hole goes? It could be layer after layer, a fractal megaverse of
hyper-realities. We’re just adding another layer.”</p>
<p>“Okay, well, time to go,” I said. “Come friend, let’s go home.”</p>
<p>My friend looked at me through tear-stained eyes and said, “But where
are my children?”</p>
