</ul>
<p>The glory of our secular materialist age is the acceleration of
wealth creation, bringing with it ease, comfort, and opportunity. This
material abundance is powered by the burning of fossil fuels, the energy
of which is put to work to satisfy human desires using machines
engineered according to the tenets of material science. This started
with the industrial revolution, which has driven the economic prosperity
of our age.</p>
<p>Here is an estimate of GDP internationally, showing how it sharply
grew from about 1800, as the effects of the industral revolution started
to take off.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The positive results of this revolution are all around us, although
not without problems: inequality, poverty, exploitation of labor, and
meaninglessness are all too readily apparent.</p>
<figure>

The clothes on your back were, in all likelihood, made like this, by
humans serving machines.

</figure>
<p>But it is against nature that industrialization reserves its most
deadly ills. It did not take long for the skies over England, the home
of the industrial revolution, to be scarred and soured by the malignant
poisons of coal-powered industry. Now the same skies are relatively
clear, not because we have learned better, but because globalization
lets us shift the toxicity somewhere else.</p>

</figure>
<p>Still, the plain fact is that most of us would rather live in a
prosperous and well-managed materialist society of secular governance
than to spend our days ploughing the soil or herding goats. And for most
people, it seems, that is all the justification they need for continuing
as they have been, more or less. Even when the harbingers of change pour
down upon us from the skies, or rise up from the ocean, or scorch
through our forests, we can only imagine a response that includes the
word ‚Äúmore‚Äù.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/morestuff.jpg" alt="People in a store fight over TVs" />
<figcaption>
We fight and struggle to secure brighter, clearer, bigger illusions with
which to hide the truth.

</figure>
<p>It is the oldest trick of Mara, the tempter, to get us to look only
at our short term pleasures. When we focus only on what <em>is</em>, on
the narrow present, we do not see what <em>will be</em>; we do not see
the consequences of our deeds. And what <em>will be</em> is shaping up,
not as a future of abundance and prosperity, but as a ruined planet
where a fractured remnant of humanity scrabble to eke out a bare
survival in lands once teeming with life.</p>

To build our future of endless possibilities, we reduce human beings to
curators of toxic filth.

</figure>
<p>Driven by the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, the same
industrial revolution that gave the lucky ones cheap and abundant goods
kicked off an unprecedented spike in global atmospheric CO2. The
following image shows CO2 going back 800,000 years.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/co2-history-1061866375.png" alt="Line graph of global atmospheric CO2 for 800,000 years." />
<figcaption>
Global atmospheric CO2 over the last 800,000 years. This brings us up to
2019; in 2024 we are at 422 ppm, which breaks the limit of this graph.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nowhere in this time span has atmospheric CO2 been close to present
levels. For that, we would have to go back 14 million years, when the
global temperature was around six degrees higher than today, and ocean
levels 10 to 20 metres higher. But if current trajectories prevail we
are headed for global atmospheric CO2 of 600 to 800 ppm by the end of
the century, conditions that have not existed on earth for over 30
million years.</p>
<p>How are we to make sense of this? We have, to be sure, endless
analyses and measurements, grave pronouncements and carefully couched
responses. That‚Äôs not what I mean by ‚Äúmaking sense‚Äù. I‚Äôm talking about
<em>meaning</em>, about who we are as creatures living in, with, and
through these changes. It seems to me that somehow our figures and
facts, theories and data, fail so completely to convey the reality that
they fall into meaninglessness. What is the point of another report,
another study, more detailed facts, when everyone is just ignoring all
the old studies?</p>
<p>It is remarkable how many graphs depicting the past thousand years or
so have the same hockey-stick shape. They go along from left to right,
marking out the centuries with change that is little and slow. Then
about two to three centuries ago, they start to curve upwards, the curve
accelerating until in the post-war period they become almost vertical.
Population, GDP, steel production, fossil fuel extraction, grain
production, atmospheric CO2‚Äîyou name it, the shape of the graph is
similar.</p>
<p>We can trace the same pattern with pictures sixty years apart,
telling the story of the human dream to fly, finally made possible by
fossil fuel. In 1903, the Wright brothers made the first powered
flight.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/First_flight2.jpg" alt="Wright brothers first flight in 1903." />
<figcaption>
The Wright Flyer was driven by a 12 horsepower engine fuelled with 3.8 L
of gasoline.

<p>Launched in 1964 as a reconnaissance platform, the Lockheed SR-71
Blackbird remains the fastest plane to fly.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/Sr71_1.jpg" alt="AR-71 Blackbird in flight." />
<figcaption>
The SR-71 was propelled by two massive turbojets burning 46,255 L of
specialized JP-7 jet fuel.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Currently in testing, the SpaceX Starship is the most powerful and
ambitious space vehicle ever built. It is the lynchpin of Elon Musk‚Äôs
dream of establishing a permanent settlement on Mars as a first step
towards colonizing the galaxy.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/SpaceX_Starship_ignition_during_IFT-5.jpg" alt="Starship at launch." />
<figcaption>
Starship burns 1,000,000 kg of methane propellant each launch.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on Musk‚Äôs plans‚Äî1000 Starships each launching three times
daily‚Äîthe carbon emissions of the Starship fleet will be greater than
the emissions of the entire rest of the world put together, more than
doubling our human-generated CO2 emisions, and condemning our plant to
certain death. For him, this is justified because it will enable us to
settle other worlds. This is madness; the earth is our only home. Thus
has the dream of flight, in 120 short years, curdled into a nightmare
beyond imagining.</p>
<p>There is another trend that follows a similar curve: atheism; or more
generally, belief systems of secular materialism that see the world as
made up of matter and derivatives of matter. It‚Äôs hard to know much
about how many non-believers there were in the past. Surely more than we
imagine, but still, probably quite few. US census number start at about
2% after World War II, growing to 8% in 1990, 14% in 2000, and about 25%
today. Presumably some of that is simply that people are more willing to
say that they are atheists, but there is no denying the rapid growth of
non-belief. And there is no denying that it follows the same trajectory
as economic and material development over the same period.</p>
<p>The demonstrable successes of material science, and its astonishing
applications in industrial machinery, stand as a monumental argument for
materialism. We often think of science as something that is ‚Äútrue‚Äù, that
has convinced the world through the clarity and correctness of its
axioms and theories, and the way its hypotheses are born out by evidence
in the real world. But if this was all there was to it, science would
remain an interesting object for academic study.</p>
<p>No, materialism has conquered the world not because of its
theoretical correctness, nor because it agrees with the evidence. We no
longer call to the gods in our fear of the dark, because we because we
can flick a switch and a light goes on. We no longer pray for release
from sickness, because we can take a pill and get better. We no longer
pray for miracles, because we have made machines that fly and sent a man
to the moon.</p>
<p>The brilliance of science shines in its effects. And those effects
are manifested in the world by machines that run on fossil fuels.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Ancient forests preserved in the earth are plundered and burned to sate
our desires; but our desires only grow.

</figure>
<p>What would have happened, I wonder, if our world had not been
abundant in fossil fuels? Imagine that Isaac Newton had come up with his
astonishing insights into physics, laying bare with precision and
clarity what had been seen only in partial glimpses. At the time, his
theory was considered extremely difficult, intriguing, yet radical and
untested. Perhaps the intelligentsia would put it to the test and even
develop some machinery based on it. Lacking fossil fuels, perhaps they‚Äôd
use windmills or watermills to grind grain or weave cloth. I think it‚Äôs
unlikely, though, that it would have changed the world so dramatically.
Many of the things we take for granted, like transportation, still rely
heavily on fossil fuels, and I doubt there would be a simple pathway to
air travel or space exploration without fossil fuels. Certainly plastics
and other petrochemicals would not exist. Most likely we would have
enjoyed cheaper grain and better engineered carriages.</p>
<p>In such a world, how would we see science? It is not obvious that
what we consider science would displace other ways of knowing. Certainly
Newton did not think so; he poured much of his thought into theology and
alchemy. Perhaps a world with modern physics but without fossil fuels
would be the best of worlds, with a gentler, slower form of material
progress. In such a world, science would, I believe, be seen as a true
way of understanding certain physical phenomena, but it would not have
been co-opted to colonize and supplant other ways of knowing.</p>
<p>But that world is not this world.</p>
<p>My point is a simple one. It is not science alone that has changed
the world, but science powered by fossil fuels.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/pump.jpg" alt="A landscape of oil pumps." />
<figcaption>
We pump oil from the earth, appoint oilmen to lead the response to
climate chaos, and then wonder why nothing seems to change.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Religions have flailed ineffectually in the face of the relentless
success of material science. Hard-liners who rail against the decadence
of modernity are dismissed as cranks, while reasonable moderates speak
of how their religion is fully in agreement with science.</p>
<p>Spiritual teachers anxious to appease materialists offer themselves
as humble supplicants at the altar of matter, soothingly reassuring
atheists that they too may be saved, eager to leap aboard the latest
trend of technology. We‚Äôve grown embarrassed at our faith, and have
given up any meaningful claim to speak of a reality beyond what science
can reveal.</p>
<figure>

Our homes, whose luxury rivals the palaces of the gods, offer no

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All around us, in any number of ways, we are now smashing into the
limits of our planet. Industrial materialism promises us infinitely
growing abundance; but what if this is just not true? What if, rather,
we have been playing like irresponsible teenagers while mum and dad are
away for the weekend? We‚Äôve been sculling the booze, maxxing out the
credit cards on hookers and blow, trashing the house, and only now,
after 48 hours of debauchery, are we starting to worry that soon
there‚Äôll be hell to pay.</p>
<p>Mum and dad are coming home.</p>

</figure>
<p>If we see industrial materialism as the handmaid, not of human
flourishing, but of short term indulgence leading to medium term
calamity, it makes us look at materialist philosophy in a different
light.</p>
<p>Before the triumph of industry, people saw the earth as sacred. They
would worship the gods, make a sacrifice, and pray for the abundance of
this year‚Äôs crop. They believed that if they lived well, and their
leaders were righteous, they would flourish.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/yamuna.jpg" alt="Yamuna river covered with toxic foam." />
<figcaption>
People still need the sacred mother Yamuna, but she is covered in toxic
scum.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Modernity poo-pooed all that and told us that we can ensure the
fertility of the soil by adding petrochemicals and grinding up the earth
with mighty machines. And sure, it worked for a while. Our population
exploded, and somehow we could feed most of them. If we keep our head
down and don‚Äôt ask too many questions, it seems to be going fine.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/farming.jpg" alt="Combine harvesters on a field of wheat." />
<figcaption>
Modern farming subjugates the earth with metal and machines powered by
oil.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But what of that other, hidden thing? The day that we cannot see?
That time in the future when the ice has melted and the coiling dragons
of oceanic currents have failed; when the jungles are deserts and the
fish are rotting carcasses; when the plankton has vanished; when fire
hunts naked in cities; when the endless expanses of wheatlands are
reduced to howling dust. On that day, what oil-powered machine, what
petrochemical will restore life to the lifeless earth?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/clear-sky-china.jpg" alt="." />
<figcaption>
When even the sacred Air, the breath of the gods, who has selflessly
given us oxygen to breath every moment of our lives, is utterly
despoiled, we deploy our industrial machinery and technological knowhow
to create illusions reminding us of what once was and is no more.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We have relentlessly scoured the sacred from the world, filling the
earth‚Äôs veins with acid, scoffing contemptuously at those who worship
the sky and the rivers. We point and laugh at how useless their endless
rites were, how cruel their sacrifices; and how, even when they served
their gods properly with ritual and oblation, they were still struck
with drought or failure.</p>
<p>Yet it is a singular fact that none of them, not a single one of the
supposedly benighted superstitions of the past, bequeathed us a planet
decimated with ruin. When it comes to apocalypse, religions like to talk
big. We speak of the end of the world, our words laden with prophecy and
portent. Yet our dooms are, in the end, domestic affairs, more local
tragedy than global annihilation.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/forest.jpg" alt="A forest is clearfelled up to a line." />
<figcaption>
We think we can save the planet by planting trees; but what is the point
of planting new trees while we relentlessly annihilate the old?
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Could it be that the ancient traditions of the world did, in fact,
hold a precious wisdom, one through which humanity was able to find its
balance in nature? Could it be that the arrogant, reductive elimination
of myth and meaning, of the divinity in the stars, is leading to the
exact result foretold in the ancient wisdom?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hereafter, when kings shall be stingy and unrighteous, and when folk
shall be unrighteous, in days when the world is perverted, when good is
waning and evil waxing apace‚Äîin those days of the world‚Äôs discontent
there shall fall no rain from the heavens, the feet of the storm shall
be lamed, the crops shall wither, and famine shall be on the land. Then
shall the clouds gather as if for rain from the four quarters of the
heavens, but they shall flee away without raining. (JƒÅtaka 77)</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>The great sin of our time, the great sin of all time, has been aided
and abetted by religious leaders‚Äîweak in faith, backwards in knowledge,
secret devotees of matter‚Äîwho, rather than recognizing madness and evil
for what it is, choose to ally themselves with the great lie of
industrialized materialism: that you can have whatever you want and
never have to pay the price.</p>
<p>Now, to be sure, it is entirely possible to live by a materialist
philosophy that elevates humility and interconnectedness and repudiates
excess, just as the reverse is so painfully apparent in the many
religious people who worship only at the shrine of Mammon. But I‚Äôm not
debating philosophical possibilities here. I‚Äôm pointing to the
historical reality that the ascendancy of industrialized materialism has
been accompanied by the rejection of the sacredness of all things and
the embrace of materialist secularism.</p>
<p>Modern advocates of Buddhism often present their vision as an
essentially rational one that seems little different from a materialist
account. Yet in the early Buddhist texts we find nature is imbued with
all manner of divinity. Deities inhabit the clouds and the
thunderstorms, they shine with the sun, or protect a site for building.
Goddesses live in trees and flowers, and the moon is as divine as the
rivers. Terrifying dragons inhabit the earth, while trolls lurk in lakes
and fairies vanish in the deepness of the mountains.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Are these merely the quaint relics of a older, more superstitious
animism that the Buddha somehow could not escape? Or are they telling
us, in the language of myth and poetry, of a fundamental and profound
truth of our world?</p>
<p>Could it possibly be we, rather, who are the superstitious ones, we
who believe that certain combinations of chemicals determine our
consciousness, and that other combinations of chemicals give rise to the
life in the oceans? Who in the face of <em>everything</em> cling to the
idea that certain other combinations of chemicals or exertions of
industrial might will be our salvation, not our damnation? The belief
that mastery over matter leads to prosperity and abundance forever, an
infinity of riches on a finite world‚Äîis this not the rankest, most base,
most plainly delusional of superstitions?</p>

<p>Gods, according to Buddhism, are pretty much like like you and I.
They are just born temporarily in a more exalted, more powerful state.
And like us they feel the full measure of emotions.</p>
<p>One story tells us of a monk who cut down a tree, and in doing so
injured the arm of the tree nymph‚Äôs son. She decided to kill the monk,
only to change her mind at the last minute. If this is how the gods
react to the felling of a single tree, what are they thinking now as
they gaze upon the ruin of the world?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/apsara.jpg" alt="Nymph hidden in tree." />

<p>Another story tells how the gods of an island, disgusted by the
humans‚Äô reckless exploitation and pollution, sent a tsunami to sweep
them all away.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/flood.jpg" alt="Hurricane in Florida." />
<figcaption>
Against we who live in denial, the goddess of water, provoked, rises in
anger to sweep away our homes, our lives, and our filth.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The gods have blessed us with overwhelming abundance‚Äîsparkling water,
fresh air, fruits in spring, and sun to warm our backs. But we have
ceased our offerings to them, even though we learned in time that they
asked for no rough sacrifice of life, human or animal, but merely a few
flowers, a spoon of rice, and some kind words. They asked so little and
gave so much. If it were you, would you rise to the occasion and show
infinite patience and forgiveness?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/gaza.jpg" alt="devastation of Gaza." />
<figcaption>
The end will not be born of fire alone, nor of water or of storm, but of
all these and more; and in their wake plague and war shall march under
the banners of strong men promising health and peace.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pay attention right now: can you feel it? There is a change in the
air, a shift in the skies.</p>
<p>The mood of the goddess has soured. We do not know what she will do
next, or what measure of sacrifice she will exact. We can only wait,
anxious and guilty, hoping beyond hope that she will grant us mercy.</p>
<p>Our sciences scream into the silence while our moralities crumble and
our religions founder. How did we get so lost?</p>
