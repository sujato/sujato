<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can do it,‚Äù you say, peering into the dark shadows
of the thick wood. You are lucky to have a companion to guide you under
the leaves. You know that; it takes the edge off. But still, you are
afraid.</p>
<p>Sometimes you almost forget your companion. As you step off the main
road and under the darkling leaves, you are entranced by the smell, the
loam and the flowers, the cool odor of the shadows. It takes a while for
your eyes to adjust, but now, as you venture deeper, you begin to notice
the riches of the forest. The trees grow broader and taller, the mosses
damper and more varied. There, did you see that? Was it a squirrel?</p>
<p>You do not know the way, but your companion does. They are just
there, sometimes stepping a little ahead, sometimes waiting back, or
turning their head a little to suggest a new direction. They bring you
in and out again, quite safely, even when you lose the way back.</p>
<p>I had a chat once with someone who enjoyed their AI ‚Äútherapy‚Äù. It
really helped them to feel a little better, it seems. They particularly
enthused about how insightful the machine was. It saw things in them
that they did not know themselves.</p>
<p>The same things that they enthused over were, to me, obvious red
flags. A therapist is your companion in the forest. If you come back
from your walk saying what a great guide they were in the woods,
something is wrong. A therapist walks with you on your journey, stepping
beside you, subtly opening a path, steering you without you realizing it
away from danger and towards beauty. When you come back from your walk,
you do not talk about the guide, but about the magnificence of the
forest.</p>
<p>A therapist helps you find yourself. If you think your therapist is
insightful, they‚Äôre at fault; they have slipped into pride, showing off
their cleverness. Their job is not to give you insights, but to guide
you to your own insights. The reality is, when you are in session with a
therapist, if you are being honest and engaging in good faith, they will
usually see what you need quite quickly. But they don‚Äôt tell you that,
because that‚Äôs <em>their</em> insight, not yours. They hold back the
insight, guiding you towards your understanding without you even
noticing, and speaking, if at all, after careful reflection, only when
they are confident that you are ready.</p>
<p>As the therapeutic process unfolds, there will be times when you feel
uncomfortable. The guide has brought you to a place of steep rocks, of
barren land, of prickly vines. As the painful feelings emerge, you
struggle to understand or even recognize them for what they are. They
feel somehow not right; you are supposed to be feeling better, you are
being honest, you are doing all the right things.</p>
<p>So the dim, confused feelings are projected, as is the human way,
seizing on a convenient scapegoat, usually the therapist themselves. The
therapist knows this, they are ready for it, and they hold the
projection without reacting. They know that the forest has dark places,
ugly and painful places, and they want to show you that you do not have
to live in fear of them. Yes the danger is real, but if you are careful
you will make it through.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens that this process is incomplete when the therapy
session ends. You still harbor the resentment, the bitterness. But time
is up and you are going home already, to stew in it until next time.
Maybe it will take a long time to pass through. This isn‚Äôt working, you
think, I feel worse than before.</p>
<p>At your next session you sit with your therapist, feelings coursing
through your body, in silence. You are both trying to be patient. You
both breathe the same air.</p>
<p>A machine is not patient. It does not breathe. It does not consider,
mindfully, how your path is unfolding as you take your tentative first
steps. It gets a series of ones and zeros as input and then spits out
another series of ones and zeros, statistically determined by the
dataset, represented by a string of Unicode glyphs on your screen, and
interpreted by you as words with meaning. But it has no meaning, for it
has no intent. It is not helping you, for it has no compassion. It
serves only the will of its masters: and that is not you.</p>
<p>The good part, though, is that a machine is cheap and it is always
available. You don‚Äôt have to make an appointment and travel to the other
side of town. If you feel bad, you can talk to it in the middle of the
night, getting a little mental health comfort when you need it.</p>
<p>This, while it is felt by the client as beneficial, is the path to
narcissism. The path <em>must</em> be slow and difficult, for that is
the way of growth. You can‚Äôt grow a forest overnight, and if you do grow
a forest as quick as you can, you get a plantation of shallow-rooted
pine, not a deep wood of oak and moss.</p>
<p>Now as for ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, AI seems cheap, as you can use many services for
free or at a small cost. But this is an illusion; it is what they want
you to think. AI is, in fact, incredibly expensive. It costs hundreds of
billions of dollars, and investors are cautioned that their money should
be considered a donation, as they are unlikely to get it back.</p>
<p>It seems cheap because <em>you are not paying the price</em>. The
cost of AI is externalized‚Äîto the poor, to the environment, to the
future ravaged by AI-amplified climate chaos. Do you believe, if you
took into account the vast immoralities that created AI‚Äîthe slavery of
tens of thousands of children, the plagiarism without consent of human
creative work, the grinding of mountains into paste, the consumption of
energy enough to power entire nations‚Äîthat <em>any</em> use of
large-scale AI is remotely ethical? And if you cannot justify all this,
then how can a therapeutic process built on theft, fire, and slavery
ever be remotely acceptable?</p>
<p>There is a reason why your therapy sessions are limited in time, and
why they come only at stated intervals. The therapist is teaching you
about boundaries and about coping. You need to learn resilience, to
handle things yourself when the therapist is not there. A therapist,
after all, is a person, who exists because of their own intrinsic worth
as a sentient being, not as a servant to your needs. They hold you in
the space they create, space that you know is valuable and precious,
because you have to book in advance and show up on time. So you are
learning that <em>you are worth the precious time and attention of
another human being</em>. You are also learning that <em>you cannot
demand that attention whenever you want</em>.</p>
<p>A pitfall of therapy, one that therapists are well aware of, is that
it is self-centered. You can sit there and just talk about yourself and
the therapist has to listen. For someone with narcissistic tendencies,
therapy is catnip. If we remove the boundaries and devalue the
experience, the same words that come out of a machine no longer have any
meaning. They are no longer precious, rare gems of thoughtful response
carefully weighed and withheld until the perfect moment.</p>
<p>Most of the things that a therapist has to say are pretty simple. If
you‚Äôre in the biz, you have a big bag full of ‚Äúwise‚Äù sayings that you
can deploy whenever you want. And they‚Äôre fine. Clich√©s, maybe, but it
is true, you really should believe in yourself. You really should learn
to shake off your worries, or to spread love in small actions. The art
of therapy is to wait until the exact moment when the clich√© really
means something.</p>
<p>When social media and smartphones really took off, I was worried. I
thought they were super-addictive, and that they would lead to a spike
in mental health problems. Seeing how so much social media triggered
body awareness and appearance issues, I feared this would be specially
dangerous for young women. Now, a decade later, we have abundant
evidence that this is true. Mental illness started to accelerate around
2012, the age of the smartphone; and it specially affects teenage
girls.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm calling it now: machine ‚Äútherapy‚Äù will lead to a massive epidemic
of mental illness. In a decade, we‚Äôll be seeing rates of all kinds of
afflictions accelerate, starting now, around the mid-20s, as AI usage
becomes the norm. We‚Äôll find the kids routinely turn to AI for therapy,
especially as they hear adults praising it, and as dedicated apps show
it off. And it will do the same thing that social media does: give them
a drip-drip-drip of shallow pleasure response, getting them addicted,
while reinforcing their hatreds and prejudices, trapping them in a cycle
of emotional meaninglessness. And for them, that will be therapy.</p>
<p>If they do end up seeing a genuine therapist, how could they not
compare the two? ‚ÄúMy next session is not until Tuesday; let me just talk
to the machine.‚Äù The machine is always there, it always says the right
thing, it always makes you feel better. The therapist is never there,
they speak little and tangentially, and they make you feel complicated,
unnameable, and unpleasant things.</p>
<p>One of the most insidious evils of machines is how they seduce the
gullible. It‚Äôs happened to me so many times; it happened again just the
other day. Someone send me an email asking for feedback on a course they
were putting together. It was a bunch of AI slop, so I didn‚Äôt read it,
just asked him to get rid of the slop and speak to me like a human. He
was annoyed and argued with me about how he used AI for ideas, to
reflect on, and so on, telling me that the Buddha would have agreed. I
know his person well; he has read a few books on Buddhism, but knows
nothing beyond a few ideas that modern Buddhists talk about. But he‚Äôs
confidently telling me that I‚Äôm wrong, that he knows better than I about
what the Buddha would have wanted.</p>
<p>Machines undermine expertise because they make fools think they are
wise. It happens every time. Someone thinks they understand, and they
carefully explain how they use a machine in a responsible and meaningful
way. Then they are lucky enough to have an actual expert step in and
say, ‚ÄúHang on, that‚Äôs not what that means, it‚Äôs actually this.‚Äù But they
don‚Äôt like that, because if the machine is wrong, that means they are
not as smart as the machine thinks they are. Maybe, in fact, they have
fools all along for listening to machines. Since the machine already has
its hooks in, amplifying attachment and ego, this unwelcome conclusion
must be rejected. Instead, the expert must be wrong, and their knowledge
and wisdom, hard-won from a lifetime of effort and experience, is
dismissed.</p>
<p>Machines will destroy the very idea of therapy. Who would pay to have
someone sit with them in uncomfortable silence, when you can snuggle
under your warm doona with a voice that is always there, always
comforting, always making you feel better? And that is so important,
because you always need someone. A person who will listen and talk, like
the machine. Because you‚Äôre still suffering. Every day, the stress, the
anxiety, the depression, they just keep circling back. As you get more
and more comfort from better and better machines, your short-term buzz
masks a deeper and deeper descent into madness.</p>
<p>Over the years, your machine is always there. It whispers its words
of wisdom, and you, tired and sad and alone, take those words into your
heart until they become your own. Little by little, your mind is
colonized by the unthoughts of a machine, until your own mind is
constantly echoing and repeating the unthought, lost under so many
layers of time and memory that you cannot even begin to distinguish what
is yours and what is the machine‚Äôs.</p>
<p>What thoughts does a machine think? That‚Äôs the wrong question: it‚Äôs
what they want you to ask. Machines don‚Äôt think. They serve their
masters. Look to their masters and you will see the minds of machines.
It is their thoughts that will, slowly slowly slowly, make their way
through the machines and, drip by drip by drip, make an impression on
your mind when you are at your weakest and most vulnerable.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA mind of metal and machines,‚Äù said Tolkien of the
wizard-industrialist Saruman. And that is what we are choosing. A
perpetuity of ever-deepening mental health crisis, as a generation
chooses machine-generated seratonin buzz over painful insight.</p>
<p>The deepest wish of a therapist is to never see you again. There is
no prouder day in their life than when they say to you, ‚ÄúYou seem well,
do you think we should finish off here? You‚Äôve found your way, I just
know you‚Äôll do great.‚Äù The days they can say that are all-too-rare. They
will be fighting back tears, trying to keep a professional demeanor. You
will casually melt their heart with your smile and say, ‚ÄúWell, I will
miss this. But yeah, I think maybe I can do it.‚Äù</p>
