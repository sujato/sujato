<h2 id="monks-and-politics">monks and politics</h2>
<p>Monks shouldn‚Äôt be political, they say.</p>
<p>Like as not, monks who say that have a framed photo of the king and
queen elevated near their shrine. Not quite worshiped, exactly. But when
they speak of royalty they say things like, ‚Äúthose great beings from the
national pantheon‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Thai king‚Äôs wealth is counted in tens of billions of dollars.
Poor people know exactly what they have, down to the last cent, and they
have to account for it all. When it comes to the rich, is it thirty
billion? Or fifty billion? Or much, much more? Who can say?</p>
<p>Do you really think that kind of money can ever be clean?</p>
<p>It turns out, monks doing politics is fine, if it‚Äôs the right sort of
politics‚Äîelitist, royalist, misogynist, patriarchal. The kind of
politics that reinforces monks‚Äô prestige and wealth.</p>
<p>Or another sort of politics is tolerated, barely: the pleasant-left.
The kind of politics that thinks in terms of civil-minded people having
reasonable conversations about effective solutions. The kind of politics
that might have made sense a decade or two ago. The politics of hope and
change, of a future that bends towards justice. The politics that built
the UN and the EU, that created the international order of human rights
and democracy. The kind of politics we were taught at school, that we
were meant to aspire to.</p>
<p>You sit at the table with your people on one side, and rapists,
thieves, and murderers on the other, and look forward to a productive
conversation. And everyone agrees that there are no bad guys, and the
important thing is to stay civil and see both sides. Until <a
href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/behold-a-pale-horse-race?utm_source=publication-search">a
wise woman reminds you</a> that every abuser needs an enabler. And you
wonder who the enablers are. And you realize with a cold chill: it‚Äôs the
people who sit at the table.</p>
<p>No, the two sides are not the same. <a
href="https://rantt.com/gop-admins-had-38-times-more-criminal-convictions-than-democrats-1961-2016">They
have never been the same</a>. But table-sitting has left us with the
kind of politics where one side systematically murders tens of thousands
of children in Gaza, and the other side is really bad.</p>
<p>I cannot help but wonder, ‚ÄúWhat sort of people are we that have come
to this?‚Äù</p>
<p>Our understandings no longer make sense, our moral truisms are
betrayed as lies. But even in such a tumbling scree of change, something
in the recent US election really shocked me.</p>
<p>The union of the two towers.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-are-the-way-we-are">why we are the way we are</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm just a monk. What would I know? Not much, really. I‚Äôve no
illusion about that.</p>
<p>I know about early Buddhist texts, and I‚Äôm pretty confident when I
speak on them. They tell us that we should learn to recognize evil; and
when we recognize it, to stop doing it. This, then, is an essay about
evil, about how to recognize it, and how to stop participating in
it.</p>
<p>I know a little something something about my own mind, too. Well, I
picked up a thing or two.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a child of the eighties. Most kids my age were doing the thing,
getting a career and a job, listening to Wham! I was too cool for that.
I listened to The Clash, or The Triffids, or Do Re Mi, or later, Nina
Simone and Charles Mingus. And I helped pass out leaflets warning that
Rupert Murdoch was a threat to society.</p>
<p>We had moral conviction, but we passed the time chatting in pubs, our
minds too blurred by beer and pot, our lives too comfortable, to ever
really do anything that would make a difference.</p>
<p>And here we are. I gave up hope long ago. I‚Äôm not expecting to change
anything, least of all anyone‚Äôs mind. So I don‚Äôt really think of myself
as political. It‚Äôs just who I am. Call it a failure of imagination. I
just can‚Äôt imagine being the kind of person who would live at a time
when the whole world was burning and never say or feel anything.</p>
<p>I like a good scalpel, one that cuts so deep it lets out not blood,
but light. I write not to persuade but to make sense; for myself, and
maybe for someone else.</p>
<p>As a Buddhist monk, I‚Äôm surrounded by nice people who like to imagine
that other people are nice too. It‚Äôs a comforting thought. I like being
around people like that.</p>
<p>But I don‚Äôt believe them. I don‚Äôt trust comforting thoughts. I see
evil all around, rising like the tide, rising like the warming oceans. I
fear it. It harrows my soul. I don‚Äôt have answers or solutions. All I
can do is bear witness with my words.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve come across the writings of Sarah Kendzior. She‚Äôs the Cassandra
of Calamity, a writer whose every sentence slices and dices to get at
the truth. At first I thought she was, well, a bit much. Too dark. Then
over time I began to realize that pretty much everything she had
predicted was coming true.</p>
<p>She‚Äôs not an ideological writer. She looks at how people have behaved
and assumes they‚Äôll probably keep behaving that way. And she brings the
receipts. Bulging binders of them. Dark, blood-stained receipts of how
America became a mafia state.</p>
<p>Her politics is one of character. The character of criminals, for the
most part, does not change. If we want to see clearly, we must hold on
to our own character, our moral clarity, our love and compassion.</p>
<p>This essay leans heavily on her work. I won‚Äôt document the details;
better just go to the source. <a
href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/">She doesn‚Äôt paywall her
writing</a>.</p>
<p>I want to understand this moment in time, because it will define the
place we will all live in.</p>
<p>I want to understand the union of the two towers.</p>
<h2 id="of-dark-lords-past-and-present">of dark lords past and
present</h2>
<p>Saruman was the more interesting of the evil lords. Sauron was just a
primal ferocity of evil. Saruman was talented and respected, yet fell
prey to weaknesses that were almost adorably childish. Power and
dominion, and most of all, pride.</p>
<p>Saruman fell into Sauron‚Äôs grasp, but it did not happen easily. He
was, by Gandalf‚Äôs account, the greatest of the wizards, a pure being
from the land of Valinor sent on a mission to redeem the fallen world
from evil. He descended into inhumanity by being all-too-human, by
continuing to long for the things that men like him are not supposed to
long for. All people, saints aside, are liable to such weaknesses, but
powerful men more than most.</p>
<p>But there was more to it than that. He didn‚Äôt just abstractly covet
Sauron‚Äôs power. He was connected to Sauron through his choice to use a
dangerous item of magical technology, the palantir.</p>
<p>The palantir were created by the Numenoreans of old to manage their
vast empire. Large crystal seeing stones, they were distributed at key
points throughout the realm for the use of trusted high officials. But,
like any object of power, they had a fatal flaw. They didn‚Äôt just show
you an objective view of truth, they enabled a melding of minds. This
was no problem when used as intended. But in the hands of an evil being
of great power, the palantir enabled a stronger mind to dominate a
lesser, and to make them see what they wanted to see. Even a mind as
keen as Saruman‚Äôs was no match for the will of Sauron.</p>
<p>So far did he fall in his hubris that he even believed Sauron would
share power. Saruman was fool enough to believe he could ally with
Sauron in the ‚Äúunion of the two towers‚Äù. His overreach was to prove his
doom.</p>
<p>The 2024 U.S. election also witnessed a union of the two towers: the
conmen, rapists, and mafioso of Trump and his circle with the
technofascists Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. (I want you to know that when
I call these people ‚Äúrapists‚Äù or ‚Äúfascists‚Äù, these terms are not meant
as insults. They are simple factual descriptors. We should use the word
for the thing.)</p>
<p>Up till now, the world of technology has retained a skepticism about
government, leaning towards a libertarian ethos of innovation and
progress, in the fervent belief that the future will be built by the
unfettered genius of the engineers. Now they are not merely supporting
one side, they have joined it decisively, sponsoring the electoral
campaign, mentoring the vice-presidential candidate, and even setting up
their own government department.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the AI surveillance company owned by Peter
Thiel is called Palantir. It is a digital analogue of Tolkien‚Äôs
seeing-stones. As usual, Thiel seems to miss the point, unaware that he
is the bad guy. He controls a system that lets governments see what he
wants them to see, in the way he wants them to see it. His systems are
ostensibly about information and intelligence, but in fact they create a
new layer of unreality, so that a nation‚Äôs leaders do not have to
respond to the actual people who believe themselves to be citizens. All
that matters is their digital representation.</p>
<p>Palantir does not operate in isolation. They partner with an AI firm
<a
href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/palantir-partners-anduril-advance-ai-154658126.html">named
Anduril</a>, after the elvish sword wielded by Aragorn. One of their
signature products is named Anduril Menace, <a
href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anduril-palantir-accelerate-ai-capabilities-220000806.html">described
as a</a> ‚Äúfamily of deployable compute and communications systems to
instrument the tactical edge for the government‚Äôs secure, large-scale
data retention and distribution.‚Äù And they are linked to a <a
href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/sauron-secures-funding">home
security company that is actually named Sauron</a> after the all-seeing
Eye, the dark lord himself, faithless and accursed. I guess I respect
their honesty. They‚Äôre not playing pretend any more.</p>
<h2 id="ai-weirding-the-romanian-election">ai weirding the romanian

<p>For a long time the technocrats have wanted to replace government
with AI. That this will happen is an article of faith, a resigned (or
hopeful) ‚Äúwhen‚Äù rather than ‚Äúif‚Äù. We are now far enough down the road to
see how they will do it‚Äîor try to.</p>
<p>Already governments are primed to accept their machine overlords.
They have tasted the sweet, sweet honey of tech dollars. More than that,
governments are mostly run by old men whose chief understanding of
technology is to realize that they don‚Äôt understand it.</p>
<p>Like most everyone else, they are liable to imagine that AI is
smarter than them, so they turn to AI to answer their problems. AI is a
perfect government adviser, as it immediately offers plausible-sounding
words whose factuality is of little concern. AI makes fools sound smart.
Worse, it makes fools think they are smart.</p>
<p>Take Romania for example. 18 months ago, they announced a new
government advisory AI named Ion, which apparently scanned social media
to tell the government about the sentiment of the Romanian people. Of
course, what it would actually gather from this is the sentiment of
those Romanian people who use social media. That is, insofar as it was
reading the words of people at all, as most social media is made by
AI.</p>
<p>At the time, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/romania-ion-ai-government-honorary-adviser-artificial-intelligence-pm-nicolae-ciuca">Romanian
PM Nicolae Ciuca said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have the conviction that the use of AI should not be an option but
an obligation to make better informed decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little over a year later and suddenly Romanian elections are
dominated by an extreme right figure who popped out of nowhere, unknown
to almost anyone until the current election cycle.</p>
<p>Early speculation that he was a Russian plant was soon confirmed. <a
href="https://bsky.app/profile/ridt.bsky.social/post/3lcqtd5h3q223">His
rise was also boosted</a> by an unholy combination of <a

medicine and saints</a>‚Äù. But the Guardian is surely correct to
attribute his rise to <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/calin-georgescu-romania-election-hard-right-candidate">the
feckless leadership of mainstream parties</a>. Extremism may well be
promoted by foreign powers, but it only finds a foothold in weak
nations.</p>
<p>His popularity was entirely due to his massive TikTok presence.
TikTok was the first social media based on AI, its uncanny
recommendations powered by a machine ultimately trained on Chinese
social media data. Romanian TikTok is full of bots, and there is no
doubt that a massive AI disinformation campaign boosted his
rankings.</p>
<p>Both sides used AI, but in very different ways. The incumbent used AI
for what it is marketed as, a reliable source of accurate information.
The challenger used AI for what it is actually good for, gaming
attention and amplifying delusion.</p>
<p>Far from improving governance, the use of AI merely highlighted the
incapacity of current leadership, unable to take a step without
consulting the oracle. Did the use of AI pave the way for an extreme
right takeover? Well, clearly it did not help. It was posited as the
solution to problems, but those problems just got worse.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a pattern. The capacity of humans to lead humanity is eroded,
and the solution, somehow, is always, ‚Äúless humanity, more
machines‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="democracy-is-sick-and-its-doctor-is-a-machine">democracy is sick
and its doctor is a machine</h2>
<p>Democracy has been circling the drain for twenty years now. A <a
href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/future-of-democracy/">2020 study
found that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1974 and 2005, a majority of states became democratic for the
first time in history. However, a global democratic recession began in
2006 and has persisted ‚Äì and deepened ‚Äì over the past 14 years. Not only
have average levels of freedom (or democratic quality) been declining
globally and in most parts of the world, but the pace of democratic
breakdown accelerated and the number of democratic transitions declined,
particularly in the past five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process is ongoing; the <a
href="https://www.idea.int/gsod/2024/"><em>Global State of Democracy
2024</em></a> study says, ‚ÄúDeclines in the quality of democracy continue
to outnumber advances. One in four countries is moving forward, while
four in nine are worse off‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù is the ‚Äúrule by the people‚Äù. When the people lose faith
in humanity, they look to inhumanity for leadership: a brutal dictator,
or, even better, a machine more soulless than any psychopath.</p>
<p>Most governments do not have an official AI adviser. But how many of
the politicians, their assistants, their assistants‚Äô assistants, the
lobbyists, and the policymakers, are using AI to draft their reams of
text and policy, to workshop their ideas, to evaluate hypotheses? I‚Äôm
guessing the answer is somewhere between ‚Äúa lot‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty much
all‚Äù.</p>
<p>In doing so, they not only reveal their collapsing faith in humanity,
they advance it. No longer do they trust their own judgment or the
judgment of the people around them. They would rather listen to the
unthoughts of a machine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI could never write this well,‚Äù they muse, as the machine spits out
yet another stream of statistically-determined, plagiarized unthought.
They are content to be the editor and checker of machine dribble,
serving its fancy, and every day finding that their role becomes less
and less necessary.</p>
<p>We have seen a similar process unfold with smartphones. When they
were introduced, people started developing new services and
capabilities, offering new ways of paying for things, or identifying
yourself, or verifying a service. As time went on, more people got
phones, and providers started assuming that almost everyone has one.
Other methods were neglected, and ultimately only the phone was left. We
never really asked to live in a world where you need a phone to read a
restaurant menu; it just kind of ‚Ä¶ happened. And now we throw away <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63245150">15 million
phones every day</a>.</p>
<p>AI slides imperceptibly from ‚Äúadvising‚Äù to ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù. A student gets
a machine to spit out an essay, then, theoretically, uses their critical
thinking skills to fact check, evaluate, and rewrite. Except if the
machine output is good already, or if they left it to the last minute,
or if they never developed critical thinking skills because machines
were always there.</p>
<p>AI targets families and children for the Israeli army to murder, then
leaves the decision up to the operator. In theory. But there are
thousands of targets and no time so they just press ‚Äúgo‚Äù every time.
Technocrats promise us a glorious AI¬†future, but those innocents, the
fathers and brothers, the infants, the mothers and daughters, they have
no future. AI decided that for them. It decided death.</p>
<p>AI advice becomes AI decisions, and suddenly the machine decides <a
href="https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/2024/11/ai-governance-on-the-ground-chiles-social-security-and-medical-insurance-agency-grapples-with-balancing-new-responsible-ai-criteria-and-vendor-cost/">who
gets health care</a>, who gets welfare, who goes to school.</p>
<p>This won‚Äôt affect those who make AI. It is not for them. AI is a gun
they hold, aimed at the poor. The rich will still have human nannies,
human teachers, human doctors and human nurses. The poor will be fobbed
off with crappy machines because of ‚Äúcost-cutting‚Äù, because we as a
society have decided that they are not worth the time and attention and
care of another human being.</p>
<p>A report by Techtonic Justice called ‚Äú<a
href="https://www.techtonicjustice.org/reports/inescapable-ai">Inescapable
AI: The Ways AI Decides How Low-Income People Work, Live, Learn, and
Survive</a>‚Äù, found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence, or AI, by governments, landlords,
employers, and other powerful private interests restricts the
opportunities of low-income people in every basic aspect of life: at
home, at work, in school, at government offices, and within families. AI
technologies derive from a lineage of automation and algorithms that
have been in use for decades with established patterns of harm to
low-income communities. ‚Ä¶ essentially all 92 million low-income people
in the U.S. states‚Äîeveryone whose income is less than 200 percent of the
federal poverty line‚Äîhave some basic aspect of their lives decided by
AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="there-is-only-one-machine">there is only one machine</h2>
<p>Governments have always had advisers. What has changed? One
difference is that the advisers are machines, sure. But it‚Äôs more than
that. It‚Äôs that the adviser is <em>the same machine</em>. There is, in
effect, only one machine, and pretty much everything else is just a skin
on top.</p>
<p>Every day that passes, we step further into a world where every
government is being run by the same machine.</p>
<p>There are two senses in which this is true. Let me expand this a
little.</p>
<p>Coding a modern AI model itself is straightforward. The limiting
factors are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Processors</li>
</ol>
<p>A large LLM requires the energy of a city. It feeds on enormous
fields of servers, housed in giant warehouses, full of expensive
processors running at full speed for months at a time. This is not
something that can be optimized away; we have been optimizing chips and
energy production for a long time now, and we know how they will improve
in future.</p>
<p>This costs billions, so it will forever remain in the hands of a few
massive corporations. Nor <em>should</em> such capabilities be available
to just anyone. <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x">The
environmental cost of AI is staggering</a>: the energy, the land
displacement, the minerals mined for the chips and other infrastructure,
and much more.</p>
<p>So long as we continue to allow them to exist, LLMs will be
monopolized in the hands of a few corporations. History shows us that
technology tends towards monopolization. (Have you tried buying a phone
recently? Did you enjoy trying the Firefox OS, or Ubuntu Touch, or
Nokia‚Äôs Symbian, or Samsung‚Äôs Tizen, or Palm‚Äôs webOS, or Blackberry OS,
or Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Mobile? No, you chose between iOS and Android,
between a 3.5 trillion dollar company and a 2 trillion dollar company.
All those operating systems lost in time, like tears in rain.) This
tendency is true even in fields where scale is not needed‚Äîhow much more
so in a field where scale is the defining feature?</p>
<p>Currently there are a few large players in the field, but over the
next few years this will be winnowed down as the biggest players strive
to outperform their competition the only way they know how, by throwing
even more money at the problem.</p>
<p>There is a deeper sense in which even this modest differentiation is
an illusion. Far and away the most important factor in determining the
capabilities of an LLM is the data. The differences in the way the model
is constructed and run are relatively trivial; they affect the manner of
operation, not the underlying capabilities. The data used by these LLMs
is not public, since AI companies arrogate to themselves the right to
take everyone else‚Äôs data but not share their own data. But so far as we
know, they are basically using all the data that they can get their
hands on. There are obviously massive overlaps in the data between the
different AIs, which is why the basic capabilities of the major AI
models are similar. It cannot be otherwise.</p>
<p>Thus all major LLMs use much of the same underlying data. They are
minor variations on a theme. The same pseudointelligence offering the
same pseudoadvice to every government in the world. Soon, to every
pseudogovernment.</p>
<p>This is how AI is a fundamentally totalitarian technology. It only
works because of scale, and only a vanishingly few people can afford the
scale to build a modern LLM. Which means the power of advising the
world‚Äôs governments will increasingly fall in the hands of a few
machines, and those machines are in the hands of a few men. The
character of those men‚Äîwhose ranks include narcissists, fascists,
misogynists, and <a
href="https://allhumansarehuman.medium.com/how-we-do-anything-is-how-we-do-everything-d2e5ca024a38">abusers</a>‚Äîshapes
and informs their work at every level.</p>
<p>This is the world as it is. Except for massive and rapid intervention
by national governments, what is to stop us going further down this
road? And what when a new generation enters the government, today‚Äôs
students who have been brought up by AI? To them, turning to AI for
governance will be as natural as breathing. It‚Äôs all they will have ever
known, and all they <em>can</em> know. The more AI is allowed in
schools, the more children will fail to learn basic skills of critical
thinking. This is not a by-product of AI: it is its goal.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-the-ai-overlords-want">what do the ai overlords
want?</h2>
<p>With the latest US election, the AI overlords Peter Thiel and Elon
Musk have gone even further than I would have guessed a few months ago.
They will wield a decisive influence on the next administration through
their sponsorship of the winning party, and through their proxy, the
incoming VP, J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Musk wants to start his Department of Government Efficiency. Who
knows if it will happen, but the outlines of what they want it to do are
becoming apparent.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs got nothing to do with efficiency, obviously. The idea, it
seems, is to put a DOGE official in every government department to make
assessments. (Doge is Musk‚Äôs favorite crypto. How I loathe the fact that
I can‚Äôt even talk about this stupidity without repeating one of Musk‚Äôs
infantile, corrupt jokes.) Then they‚Äôll use an AI to winnow out the
‚Äúessential‚Äù workers and get rid of the rest.</p>
<p>Musk sacked the safety and ethics people at Twitter. With their
departure the place was overrun by Nazis and bots, which, it now seems
clear, was the plan all along. It‚Äôs what they meant by ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù. It
seems equally clear that the same plan will be applied to the US
government. This should be of utmost concern to every person on the
planet. After all, Twitter sends messages, but the US sends bombs.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll claim to use AI to replace the ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù workers. This
will hugely impact basic government services, which will, like most
things run by AI, fail repeatedly in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the government ‚Äúsavings‚Äù they will grant even more
tax cuts to the rich in order to ‚Äúbalance the budget‚Äù. The budget will
get even further out of balance as money flows into the coffers of the
AI overlords. It is widely underappreciated how much of Elon Musk‚Äôs
wealth is due to his ability to <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">convince
governments to give him money</a>.</p>
<p>The benefactors will include other criminals and oligarchs as well.
The <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/07/campaign-spending-crypto-tech-influence">crypto
world invested big in the Trump administration</a>, so they‚Äôll be paid
nicely.</p>
<p>Even worse will be the growing role of AI in the military. It‚Äôs the
same companies, the same players, the same fascists and psychopaths, who
are supplying the tech that pilots drones or targets missiles.</p>
<p>As the military becomes more dependent on AI, it will become more
dependent on the men running AI. And as multiple governments deploy
competing AI systems, they will engage, machine to machine, in an
escalating gameplay of one-upmanship, in which genocide will be a mere
side effect. The machines won‚Äôt care. And their overlords will reassure
us that, if only we grant them more power, their machines will make sure
the right side wins.</p>
<p>Thus the downward spiral accelerates: government gets worse, so its
capacity to improve is undermined, so more AI is used, which makes it
worse still. The enshittification of government.</p>
<p>Will there come a time when people get that they have been
hoodwinked, and realize that humans must remain forever the agents of
human destiny? For some, surely. But I fear it will be too late, and
perhaps not even then. Rather, the sentiment will shift to, ‚ÄúWho even
needs a government anyway? <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso">What has the
government ever done for us?</a>‚Äù We will replace the very idea of
government with a fantasy of machine utopia.</p>
<p>Let us march crisply towards our glorious future, ‚Äú<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211125232026/http://www.brautigan.net/graphics/machines/machines-loudspeaker.gif">all
watched over by machines of loving grace</a>‚Äù. Of course, it won‚Äôt be
‚Äúour‚Äù future, exactly. We will be just another inefficiency, soon to be
optimized away, or retained only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth%2C_and_I_Must_Scream">at
the pleasure of the machine</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the saddest part of all this is that, as far as Musk‚Äôs plans
go, it‚Äôs all a side issue. It‚Äôs not that he wants to create a fascist
authoritarian state on earth, particularly. What he wants is to colonize
Mars. And to that end, as he has said many times, he must get rid of <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5145776/spacex-texas-wetlands">EPA
restrictions</a> on his Starship program. <a
href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-musk-head-to-site-of-spacex-permit-problems/">That‚Äôs
why he is doing what he is doing</a>: don‚Äôt be fooled.</p>
<h2 id="a-functioning-government-is-so-ohio">a functioning government is
so ohio</h2>
<p>I realize it‚Äôs uncool to like normal things, but it is a fact that
for centuries people fought and died so that we could enjoy democracy.
They bled oceans as humanity blundered on in our violent, messy way,
towards a concept of a state that actually works. I‚Äôm no great fan of
the nation-state idea as such, but since that is what we have, we should
recognize that it is quite possible to run a nation in a reasonably okay
way. We were doing it long before AI.</p>
<p>Sure there are problems. But the biggest threat to a well-functioning
state is always the same: the corrupting power of the rich. States
function well when they rein in that power, moderate inequality, and
ensure that the benefits of work go to the people. They tend towards
autocracy, or fall apart completely, when the power of the rich is
unfettered.</p>
<p>The core <a
href="https://jaredyatessexton.substack.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-an-explainer">neoliberal
strategy</a> has always been to undermine faith in government, for a
well-functioning government acts in the public good, not in the
interests of the rich. AI is the perfect instrument to achieve this aim,
indeed, to take it to new heights, as it works by undermining faith in
humanity itself. No nation became better off by transferring wealth to
the rich‚Äîbut that is exactly what AI is accelerating. We can now
envisage a world where there is not just small government, but no
government at all. Only the machines matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-towers">the two towers</h2>
<p>The two towers correspond to the two main kinds of authoritarian
government in the world today.</p>
<p>Russia is a mafia state, government as organized crime. This is what
Trump and his cronies, all of whom are crooks, want to do to the US. We
have heard many times of the threat posed by Russia to American
democracy. While Russian interference is real and serious, the bigger
problem is that the career criminals running the US government want to
do the same thing to the US that Putin did to Russia: loot the state
assets and hock them off to oligarchs, retaining an external veneer of
government only as a shell to guarantee their impunity.</p>
<p>The technical term for this is ‚Äúkleptocracy‚Äù, ‚Äúrule by thieves‚Äù.
Personally, I think ‚Äúrapocracy‚Äù is more precise. Trump and his
cronies‚Äîrapists and enablers of rape, one and all‚Äîaim to do to the US
what they have done to so many women and girls: throw them down, strip
them of dignity, violate their bodies and their self-worth. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre
nothing, these girls. Just trash,‚Äù said Trump‚Äôs sex-trafficking partner
Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>This theme was announced by the little nazi Nick Fuentes when he
celebrated Trump‚Äôs election with a much-reposted message: ‚Äúyour body, my
choice.‚Äù A few weeks later, he was arrested for beating a woman.</p>
<p>The other kind of authoritarianism is exemplified by China, a
single-party surveillance state variously described as
techno-authoritarian or techno-nationalist. There, all citizens are
monitored and controlled by a single overbearing entity that uses
sophisticated digital tools to control every aspect of life.</p>
<p>These two visions appear quite incompatible, yet they are both part
of the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>Trump himself is a simple man with simple desires. All he wants is
what he has always wanted: to lie on a bed of gold, to destroy his
enemies, to bask in the adoration of the whole world, and to hurt women.
He wants to destroy government, not because of any ideological belief‚Äîhe
is a subliterate moron incapable of abstract thought‚Äîbut so he can
continue to do crime with impunity. Like he‚Äôs always done. First
investigated by the Department of Justice in 1973, since then he‚Äôs made
sure that everyone who matters is bought or silenced, a longterm
investment that paid off handsomely when the justice system let his
multiple prosecutions run out of time so he could become President and
put himself permanently beyond the law.</p>
<p>Trump is too small, too stupid and lazy to really destroy the world.
Musk has much bigger ambitions and is therefore much more dangerous.</p>
<p>What does Musk want? He wants to colonize Mars as the first step to
colonizing the galaxy.</p>
<p>How does he plan to do this? By building a fleet of a thousand
Starships.</p>
<p>What does he need in order to achieve this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of money. That shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. The LA Times estimated
that by 2015 he had received about $5 billion from the US government.
But that‚Äôs chump change. I‚Äôm writing a month after the 2024 US election,
in which time <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-11/elon-musk-net-worth-tops-400-billion-a-historic-first">Musk‚Äôs
estimated wealth</a> has grown by two-thirds, from $264 billion to over
$400 billion. That‚Äôs nearly $5 billion per day, or $50,000 per second.
In the time it takes you to read this sentence, he‚Äôs earned more than
you in the entire year. By the time you‚Äôve read these three list items,
he‚Äôs earned more than you your entire life.</li>
<li>Lots of methane. Starship burns 1,000 tonnes of methane each launch.
A thousand ships, each launching three times daily, will burn 3,000,000
tonnes of methane every day, putting an end to any hope of preventing
catastrophic global warming. This also should be no problem for Musk to
achieve. <a
href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/01/25/2816419/0/en/Methane-Global-Industry-Report-2024-Market-to-Surge-with-Projected-Growth-in-Renewable-Energy-and-Automotive-Industries-Long-term-Forecasts-to-2028-and-2033.html">Markets
are bullish</a> about continued massive expansion of global production
and shipping of methane‚Äîwhich is <a
href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/10/liquefied-natural-gas-carbon-footprint-worse-coal">worse
for global warming than coal</a>‚Äîas prices drop.</li>
<li>Get rid of environmental restrictions. Ideally he would end the EPA
itself, or at least disembowel it. He has repeatedly said that he cannot
achieve his aims with the burden of environmental regulation. This, too,
looks to be a solved problem, as Trump has promised to ‚Äúexpedite‚Äù
environmental regulations on large investments, <a
href="https://bsky.app/profile/leopardsatemyface.bsky.social/post/3ld4kqd2dhc2b">to
Musk‚Äôs delight</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>More than any of these, he needs a vast and highly skilled industrial
manufacturing capacity. Most US manufacturing has, of course, been moved
to China, but Tesla is built in the US. He can‚Äôt outsource to China,
because then he would be under their thumb. Anyway, <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/">he‚Äôs
a white supremacist</a>.</p>
<p>This is where Russia fails, as their manufacturing and engineering is
shoddy. So while Trump and his cronies will be looting the US like Putin
and his mates, Musk will be emulating China. Not the communist part,
just the ruthless industrial powerhouse part. To do this, he needs to
drive down wages, remove labor and environmental regulations, ramp up
engineering, mechanical, and manufacturing capacity, and build a
top-down, unaccountable system of power, where economic activity serves
the will of the great men of vision, namely him.</p>
<p>Musk is no genius. But for all his many flaws he has shown a rather
extraordinary flair for business. His business strategy is rational and
consistent, and his apparently bizarre choices ultimately serve the same
end.</p>
<p>He creates businesses whose success on Earth enable him to colonize
Mars.</p>
<p>In taking over the government, he is doing the same thing. He doesn‚Äôt
care about government efficiency, any more than he cares about public
transport (hyperloop, Boring Company), or trucks (cybertruck), or
renewable energy (SolarCity), or electric cars (Tesla), or payment
systems (Paypal). He does these things because they will help him
colonize Mars. And AI is the magic key, the palantir, that lets him
connect Trump‚Äôs criminal cabal with technofascist control.</p>
<p>The two towers will set AI to the task of looting the state,
hollowing out the government until only the shell remains, while at the
same time, increasing powers of police surveillance and citizen control
(that part is Peter Thiel‚Äôs job). They will retain only the essential
functions of a state: lavishing money on the rich and pain on the poor
and undeserving. AI will get rid of those who stand in the way, namely,
government employees.</p>
<p>This is where Musk the technofascist and Trump the sadist come
together: they both love firing people. Trump‚Äôs fame came from his
public display of cruelty‚Äîhis catchword was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired!‚Äù And Musk
sacked 80% of the staff at Twitter, driving it into the ground in the
name of efficiency.</p>
<p>Behold the union of the two towers: the crooks and the
technofascists, the Russian model and the Chinese, wedded by the machine
and united in their rapacious contempt for humanity.</p>
<p>The irony is, if Musk succeeds, he will end up destroying both forms
of authoritarianism. Climate change will burn the gangsters and the
technofascists along with the rest of us. We are NPCs, he is ‚ÄúImperator
of Mars‚Äù. He‚Äôll never reach the stars, but he may just kill us all
trying.</p>
<hr />
<p>They tell us the future belongs to the machines.</p>
<p>What they don‚Äôt tell us is that the machines answer not to the common
good, to reason, or to humanity. They answer only to the wills of their
masters. Governance by AI means governance by tech oligarchs. We are
sleep-walking into a future of global machine totalitarianism, oohing
and aahing over their toys as their dreams play out on the lids of our
own serenely closed eyes.</p>
<p>Can we stop it? For a little while, perhaps. So long as governments
remain in the hands of humans, we can pass our own laws. The thing about
machines, you can turn them off. Every day that passes, I look at the
trees and breathe in the air, and a full-on <a
href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>
grows more appealing.</p>
<p>Let us not make machines in the likeness of a human mind.</p>
