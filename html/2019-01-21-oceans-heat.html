<p>That‚Äôs how much heat is being absorbed into our oceans. Dozens of
thermonuclear bombs since you started reading this. More while you pause
to take it in. More while you think, ‚ÄúDo I really want to read
this?‚Äù</p>
<p>A recent <a
href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6423/128.full">article
in the journal <em>Science</em></a>, ‚ÄúHow fast are the oceans warming?‚Äù
by Cheng, et al, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change from human activities mainly results from the energy
imbalance in Earth‚Äôs climate system caused by rising concentrations of
heat-trapping gases. About 93% of the energy imbalance accumulates in
the ocean as increased ocean heat content (OHC). The ocean record of
this imbalance is much less affected by internal variability and is thus
better suited for detecting and attributing human influences than more
commonly used surface temperature records. Recent observation-based
estimates show rapid warming of Earth‚Äôs oceans over the past few
decades. This warming has contributed to increases in rainfall
intensity, rising sea levels, the destruction of coral reefs, declining
ocean oxygen levels, and declines in ice sheets; glaciers; and ice caps
in the polar regions. Recent estimates of observed warming resemble
those seen in models, indicating that models reliably project changes in
OHC.</p>
<p>The rate of ocean warming for the upper 2000 m has accelerated in the
decades after 1991 from 0.55 to 0.68 W m2. Multiple lines of evidence
from four independent groups thus now suggest a stronger observed OHC
warming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Global warming is not waiting for us. It‚Äôs not sitting around, giving
us a few years to get our policy agendas together. Scientists,
governments, activists, and oil companies have known what is happening
since the sixties. And this is where we are. The rise in ocean
temperatures is tracking the rise in atmospheric CO2. And both of them
are <em>accelerating</em>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs horrifying and it‚Äôs getting worse.</p>
<p>The scientists keep their cool in the peer-reviewed paper, while
their informal comments are becoming ever more desperate. Study
co-author John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences at the
University of St.¬†Thomas in Minnesota, said to <a
href="https://thinkprogress.org/study-2018-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-hottest-year-on-record-as-ocean-warming-speeds-up-a08a85c8438a/">Think
Progress</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there still is time to do something to slow this process down,
it is too late to stop serious global warming, [which] is happening
faster than we previously thought. We are also seeing the impacts, from
superstorm hurricanes and typhoons, to drought and deadly wildfires. We
are paying the consequences for ignoring the science for decades. What a
terrible legacy the denialists have left us and our children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With every message, every story, the same activist orthodoxy must be
repeated, like a mantra, an attestation of a spiritual faith: we still
have time, but we must act now. We have been saying the same thing for
half a century, and this is where we are.</p>
<p>But we won‚Äôt act. This report will come and go like thousands have
before it. Pale policies will limp into half-hearted deeds while the
poor and the vulnerable suffer and we are distracted by the next shiny
thing.</p>
<p>This is where we are. This is the world we have made. It is our home.
And we are burning it to the ground.</p>
<p>It is time to accept what we have done. Time to treasure the fleeting
days of summer. Time to wonder and time to rejoice. Time to breathe and
time to love. For soon, there will be no time for any of this.</p>
<p>Make your choices, live your life. Do what is right, because it is
the right thing to do. But don‚Äôt pretend to yourself that everything is
fine. It‚Äôs not fine, and it‚Äôs not going to be fine.</p>
<p>This is where we are.</p>
