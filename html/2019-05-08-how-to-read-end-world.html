<p>When reading about the harbingers of the end of the world—climate
catastrophe, biodiversity collapse, pollution crisis, and so on—if we
listen closely to the language, we start to discern a pattern. With few
exceptions, statements on crisis look for a balance: yes things are
serious, but here’s what we can do about it. They want to position
things such that a reasonable person would give equal weight to both
sides.</p>
<p>The problem is, when you look more closely, these statements form a
rather distinctive and somewhat disturbing pattern. In brief: bad things
are facts; good things are fantasies. Let us see some examples of
this.</p>
<p>On May 6, the Guardian carried a major article on the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report">UN
report on biodiversity collapse</a>. This is an official UN report,
backed by 450 scientists and experts, a global consensus document
compiled over three years. Biodiversity collapse, while distinct from
climate change per se, is very intimately linked, as global warming is
one of the major drivers of extinction.</p>
<p>The headline is strong: “Human society under urgent threat from loss
of Earth’s natural life”. The facts bear it out: “nature is being
destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average
over the past 10m years”; “biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%”;
“a million species are at risk of extinction”; and so the facts march
on, like a nightmare army rendered in cold statistics.</p>
<p>So then what is our response? How are we to paint the other side of
the picture? Surely if we are to frame a positive response, it must be
grounded on an equally strong basis of reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are eroding the very foundations of economies, livelihoods, food
security, health and quality of life worldwide,” said Robert Watson, the
chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Services (Ibpes). “We have lost time. We must act
now.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <em>must</em>, must we? “Must” is an odd word when you think about
it. It conveys an inevitability, a logical necessity. Who are we saying
“must” to, exactly? And who is the “we”? Well, “we” certainly doesn’t
include “me”. I’ve done what I can over the years, and it hasn’t made
any real difference. What he means is policy-makers, corporations and
the like: those who have the power to make a difference. But who are we
to compel them to do anything? “Must” exists to convey a forcefulness,
but it doesn’t correspond with any reality, because the people saying
“must” have no power, and “must” only matters when the powerful say it.
When a cop says, “You must get out of the car now”, it means something
strong and specific. When an activist says, “We must fundamentally
change our society now”, the form of the language is the same, but the
meaning is very different. The reality is, of course, that there is no
“must” about it. We can, in fact, simply keep on doing nothing, and all
the bad things will just happen. Not only is this possible, it seems
pretty gosh-darn likely at this stage.</p>
<p>What other positive news do we get? After the recent upsurge of
climate activism—school strikes, extinction rebellion protests, and so
on—the authors of the report “hope” this will push biodiversity into
public awareness in the same way as the climate emergency.</p>
<p>“Hope”. There it is. On the one hand, a terrifying and extensive
litany of devastating facts; on the other side, “hope”. And what are
they hoping for: that biodiversity will get the same attention as
climate change? For all the attention climate has got, global warming is
still happening, just as bad as ever. There is no slowing whatsoever on
the steady increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. We have demonstrated zero
ability to actually solve the climate change crisis. What, we are now
going to add yet <em>another</em> equally bad crisis to the list, and
“hope” that suddenly decades of precedent will be overturned and we’ll
do something about it?</p>
<p>The article goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Obura, one of the main authors on the report and a global
authority on corals, said: “We tried to document how far in trouble we
are to focus people’s minds, but also to say it is not too late if we
put a huge amount into transformational behavioural change.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He invokes the stock “it’s not too late”, without, however, giving
any reason for <em>why</em> it’s not too late. This is one of the most
popular incantations of the climate activist, so self-evident it needs
not concern itself with mere facts.</p>
<p>Again, see the language: the trouble is documented fact, the hope is
fantasy. “If we put a huge amount into transformational behavioural
change”. He’s right, no doubt. But the work that “if” is doing! Never in
human history has there been anything like this. “If”, he is saying, we
become effectively a completely different species. This is the nub of
the problem: humans change, but they don’t change so far, so fast, in
such numbers.</p>
<p>What kinds of change might such a transformation entail? One of the
many facts that march in dark procession suggests one specific change:
18% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by cattle. This has a simple
and obvious solution—ban cattle farming. There is no solving the climate
crisis so long as we still eat beef. Yet who, even in the progressive
parties, wants to come out and speak the simple truth? Banning cattle
farming, and indeed all forms of livestock, is just one of the
transformations that survival entails. Yet meat consumption continues to
grow faster than the world population. We <em>must</em> stop eating
meat; yet we <em>are</em> eating more and more.</p>
<p>The article acknowledges that emissions continue to rise, passing 415
parts per million of CO2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if global heating can be kept within the Paris agreement target
of 1.5C to 2C, the ranges of most species will shrink profoundly, the
paper warns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, that sneaky little “if”. Let’s be clear: it has been ages
since a 1.5 degree rise was a plausible goal. The IPCC only includes it
for hypothetical purposes. It’s not going to happen. 2 degrees is also
pretty much in the rear view mirror, and almost everyone agrees that
we’re headed far beyond that. So why do we keep discussing implausible
scenarios as if they were reasonable? We don’t see astronomers saying,
“If the earth doesn’t keep rotating around the sun”, or mechanics
saying, “If cars were run on clown tears”. Sure, technically it’s
possible we might keep to 2 degrees. It’s much more likely we’ll reach 6
degrees or beyond. Why are the upper estimates routinely omitted, while
the lower estimates are endlessly repeated?</p>
<p>The reality is, species are becoming extinct with incredible speed
right now, when global warming has barely got its britches on. When we
hit 4 degrees or 6 degrees, most of the earth will be a fiery desert,
and the seas will be wastelands. <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181129122506.htm">A
Flinders Uni study last year</a> showed that a 5 or 6 degree rise will
cause an extinction collapse that will wipe out most life on the planet.
To be clear: even under the conservative IPCC projections, we are
currently on track for this kind of temperature rise by the end of the
century. And of course, it doesn’t stop just because the century ticks
over. It just keeps going up.</p>
<p>More horrifying facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our species now extracts 60bn tons of resources each year, almost
double the amount in 1980, though the world population has grown by only
66% in that time. The report notes how the discharges are overwhelming
the Earth’s capacity to absorb them. More than 80% of wastewater is
pumped into streams, lakes and oceans without treatment, along with
300m-400m tons of heavy metals, toxic slurry and other industrial
discharges. Plastic waste has risen tenfold since 1980, affecting 86% of
marine turtles, 44% of seabirds and 43% of marine mammals. Fertiliser
run-off has created 400 “dead zones”, affecting an area the size of the
UK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy Purvis, a professor at the Natural History Museum in London and
one of the main authors of the report, said he was encouraged nations
had agreed on the need for bitter medicine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Encouraged”? Nations have “agreed”? By which he means, it’s on the
agenda to be discussed at conferences, and there’s more reports on the
way. Nice, that’ll fix it! If “must act now” is to mean anything, it
cannot continue to mean “hold another conference and hope policy changes
reflect reality”.</p>
<p>The article shares with us more words of hope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cristiana Pașca Palmer, the head of the UN’s chief biodiversity
organisation, said she was both concerned and hopeful. “The report today
paints quite a worrying picture. The danger is that we put the planet in
a position where it is hard to recover,” she said. “But there are a lot
of positive things happening. Until now, we haven’t had the political
will to act. But public pressure is high. People are worried and want
action.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Lots of positive things are happening”. Lots! And “people are
worried”. Ooh, I can just see the Koch brothers tremble! Exxon is
calling emergency meetings. The Saudis are urgently closing the oil
plants. And the Liberal party is frantically figuring out how to stop
Adani. Oh pardon me, I slipped into an alternate dimension for a moment
there. In fact, we just saw the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a
href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pompeo-arctic-climate-change-ice-melt-trade-a8902206.html">get
excited at the trade opportunities opened up by the melting arctic</a>.
And as the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/08/un-environment-report-how-australias-political-parties-plan-to-respond-to-the-crisis">Guardian’s
follow-up article makes clear</a>, the actual responses to the UN report
by Australia’s political parties—even just the cheap words, not to speak
of deeds—are “not adequate”; or as I would put it, “horrifyingly
myopic”. So deep is the ingrained inaction, our Prime Minister has
resorted to pretending to take action by <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/09/pms-office-silent-after-apparent-reference-to-environment-bill-that-doesnt-exist">making
up legislation that doesn’t actually exist</a>.</p>
<p>The article goes on, “values and goals need to change across
governments”. I couldn’t agree more. But “needs” is another “must”. It
implies necessity, but in the absence of power, it’s really just an
“ought” in boots. Values need to change: but decades of experience shows
us they <em>won’t</em> change. Is there any reason to think that this
time it will be any different?</p>
<p>More expert advice from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josef Settele, an Ipbes co-chair and entomologist at the Helmholtz
Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, said: “The situation is
tricky and difficult but I would never give up. The report shows there
is a way out. I believe we can still bend the curve. People shouldn’t
panic, but they should begin drastic change. Business as usual with
small adjustments won’t be enough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, we’re used to the language: “I believe”; “people shouldn’t”;
“should begin drastic change”; “won’t be enough”.</p>
<p>“I would never give up” is a specially revealing turn of phrase. No
matter what the facts, not matter what the reality, he would never give
up; or so at least he says. What we will actually do in the uttermost of
need is hard to say, hidden even to our innermost soul. But a realist
would say, “I shall have hope so long as there are grounds for hope, and
when hope is gone, I will prepare for what is to come.” For surely we
can agree that in this world, there are things that we cannot change.
When “hope” is an absolute virtue, to speak of reality is a sin. The
activists become as priests, intoning a sacred doctrine whose persuasive
power stems not from evidence, but from authority and the sheer
constancy of repetition.</p>
<p>The facts are hard, huge, weighing down like a mountain in the sky.
Next to that is the ritual incantation of the need for hope. Since this
is mere positive thinking, there is no need for facts to back it up.
It’s great poetry—the power of sheer faith, the Davids of the world
righteously standing up to the Goliath of death—but I just don’t believe
it any more. Any incantation of the need for change that does not
acknowledge the reality of how hard and unlikely it is; that does not
include facts on how change has occurred in the past; that does not deal
the very real presence of massive, powerful forces that will combat any
change at all; to me, these are just empty words.</p>
<p>I’m not meaning to criticise the Guardian or news media in general
here. The Guardian has done a great job of climate reporting. It’s just
a convenient source for the kind of language that is routinely employed
by journalists, activists, scientists, and politicians. We are facing a
crisis before which our beliefs and our language quail. “Crisis”,
“emergency”, “collapse”; none of these are strong enough. How are we to
speak of the coming times when our language was forged in plenty?</p>
<p>Religions take a longer view and have a word at the ready:
apocalypse. All those facts that are listed in the reports, they are
real. They’re not just numbers, not just ideas. They depict the fabric
of our world as it unravels before our eyes. Look around you: this is
what apocalypse looks like. It doesn’t come all at once. For the people
of Puerto Rico or Mozambique it is the lived reality. For the lucky ones
such as myself, it is mere rumours and fears. But it is coming, and if
anything is to save us, it will not be the potted incantations of
positive thinking mantras.</p>
