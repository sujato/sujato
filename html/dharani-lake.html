<h1>Lake Dhāraṇī; or, when the earth is a lake</h1>
<p>One of the common words in Indic for “Mother Earth” is <em>dharaṇī</em>, literally the “bearer”, a word also used for pregnant women. </p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/mother-earth/14623">https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/mother-earth/14623</a></p>
<p><em>Dharaṇī</em> seems to be found in only two places in early Pali. In Thag 1.50, I had previously translated it as “mother earth”. Norman has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth is sprinkled</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of passive voice here is puzzling. The line is straightforward, if obscured by word order and line breaks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dharaṇī ca siñcati</em><br>
<em>Dharaṇī</em> pours<br>
<em>vāti Māluto</em> <br>
gale blows<br>
<em>vijjutā carati nabhe</em><br>
lightning flashes across the sky</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the earth cannot pour, it is poured upon, thus Norman’s translation goes against the grammar. Not only is the passive voice unjustified grammatically, it’s also bad poetry, as the force of the line is to emphasize the active and turbulent skies of a tropical storm. </p>
<p>But while <em>dharaṇī</em> does not appear elsewhere in early Pali as the “earth”, she does appear as a celestial lake in the mythical north (DN 32:7.48).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a lake there too named Dharaṇī<br>
whence the clouds rain forth,<br>
and the rains disperse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the reference in Thag 1.50 must be to the same lake, who “pours forth”. It’s a natural idea to think that the rain must come from a giant lake in the sky. </p>
<p>Note too that in this little line, the poetic term <em>māluta</em> is used. This is from the <em>maruta</em>, the group of boisterous gods of the Rig Veda who buffet the sky during thunderstorms, i.e. “gales”. </p>
<p>It’s only a small detail, of course, but it does show how context is king. By taking too little account of the mythological context, Norman not only weakened the poetry of the line, but was forced to translate against the grammar.</p>
