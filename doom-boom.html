</header>

<p>My news source of choice, <em>The Guardian</em>, recently published
an article by Alexandra Villarreal on the so-called climate ‚Äúdoomers‚Äù:
<em>Meet the doomers: why some young US voters have given up hope on
climate</em> <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/meet-the-doomers-some-young-us-voters-have-given-up-hope-on-climate?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other"></a>.
I have <a
href="https://lokanta.github.io/2019/05/08/harbinger3/">previously
critiqued their coverage of climate change</a>, and will repeat here the
caveat that I made there: I do this out of love. <em>The Guardian</em>
is the best mainstream source on climate change and other issues, and
their work is invaluable. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre perfect.</p>
<p>The premise of the article is true and important. There are young
people in the US (and elsewhere) who are really convinced that the end
is certain. And this has genuine implications in terms of mental health
and political engagement. But this article, to my mind, exemplifies all
the wrong ways to address this.</p>
<p>The essence of the critique of ‚Äúdoomerism‚Äù is that it prompts people
to despair. This is a false dichotomy, stemming from the Christian value
of ‚Äúhope‚Äù, which in turn derives from Christianity‚Äôs origins as an
apocalyptic cult who believed that Jesus would return in their
lifetimes, and had to deal with what happened when he failed to show up.
‚ÄúHope‚Äù was changed from being a realistic expectation of a positive
outcome to being a metaphysical absolute. The righteous must clung to it
despite all evidence, for the relinquishment of hope is a sure sign of
spiritual and moral depravity.</p>
<p>But hope is not a value in Buddhism, and so the opposite of hope is
not despair. To motivate our goodness, we look to the present, to what
we can see. And when we do turn to the future, we keep our expectations
grounded in what is reasonable and based in evidence. Rather than
insisting on hope at all costs, we should ask ourselves, is something
worth doing because it is good? If it can help ourselves or others, even
a little, it is still worth doing.</p>
<p>Climate scientist Michael Mann is quoted in the article. He is a
legend, and I have nothing but respect for his work on climate change.
But I fear that his response to doomerism misunderstands the spirit of
the times; against doomerism he posits boomerism.</p>
<p>He thinks that existing institutions can be influenced and tweaked to
work in favor of the environment. The problem is, people like him have
been trying to do that for decades, and it hasn‚Äôt worked. How long can
you keep on saying, ‚ÄúJust a bit more, let‚Äôs do the same thing again,
this time it‚Äôll make a difference‚Äù? At what point does this ring
hollow?</p>
<p>Mann points to Russian disinformation and scientific
misunderstandings as the source of doomerism. Me, I‚Äôm more convinced by
the fact that CO2 levels just keep going up. This is not caused by the
conventional environmental movement, but it sure hasn‚Äôt been stopped by
them.</p>

<p>Atmospheric CO2 is not just growing, it is doing so at an
accelerating rate:</p>

<p>Cut young people some slack. It isn‚Äôt their fault that we are in this
situation: it‚Äôs ours. And it isn‚Äôt their fault that the enviornmental
movement has utterly failed to reduce atmospheric CO2: it‚Äôs ours.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm concerned about the shallow argumentation and lack of supporting
evidence in this article, which I fear reflects a shallow understanding
of the problem at large. If you follow the links, for example, they are
of surprisingly poor quality. Under ‚Äúfalse equivalency between Trump and
Biden‚Äù, for example, we find a blank page.</p>
<p>Under ‚Äúdiscouraging climate activists‚Äù one might have hoped to find
some information about empirical studies on the effectiveness of
different rhetorical strategies. Instead, we find a tweet(!) The tweet,
by Alexandria Villase√±or, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greta sparked a movement that has thousands of youth learning about
climate change and realizing they have power. what have you done <span
class="citation" data-cites="RoyScranton">@RoyScranton</span>? besides
tell us we‚Äôre doomed so we should go back to school and learn how to be
good little capitalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is evidently in response to Scranton‚Äôs remark in the linked
article. I will leave it to the reader to follow up on this and see
whether it is an accurate representation of Scranton‚Äôs position.</p>
<p>But what is curious to me is the description of Greta Thunberg‚Äôs
success. Let me be clear: I think Greta Thunberg is one of the most
amazing human beings in existence. Hear her words at the 2019 United
Nations Climate Action Summit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And
yet I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying.
Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass
extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of
eternal economic growth. How dare you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is incredible. But what, exactly, has she achieved? If the point
of the tweet was to contrast Greta‚Äôs success with Scranton‚Äôs failings,
what does that success consist in? Convincing young people they have
power? Power to do what, exactly? The only power that actually matters
is the power to reduce atmospheric CO2. Until they do that, climate
change remains on full steam ahead.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstandings, I agree completely with everything Greta
has inspired. If anything, I don‚Äôt think it goes far enough. I think all
schoolchildren everywhere in the world should simply refuse to go to
school until the climate crisis is solved. Maybe that would get some
action. Until then, as Greta herself has said, all her school strikes
and her activism have, in her words, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/06/greta-thunberg-says-school-strikes-have-achieved-nothing">achieved
nothing</a>.</p>
<p>Another link appears for the text, ‚Äúthe Chinese economy [has made]
substantial progress diversifying from coal‚Äù. This links to a puff piece
published by a ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù US think tank whose board members include
Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, former heads of US DoD and CIA,
and CEOs of Boeing, Coca-Cola, Hyatt Hotels, various banks; oh, and Rex
W. Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The think
tank receives funding from multiple defense contractors, and according
to the NY Times, <a
href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.htm">the
Chinese Government</a>. This is not a reliable source for information
about the environment.</p>
<p>China is big and complicated, and their impact on climate change is
likewise complicated. Yes, there are major investments in renewables,
but there is also a heckton of coal and other nasties. The government is
riven with corruption, making reliance on reported figures a dubious
proposition. Many supposedly closed coal plants, for example, are still
in operation. In 2015, they led the world with $1.4 trillion in
subsidies for fossil fuels, <a
href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509">according
to the IMF</a>. And recent data shows that the trend in China has
reverted to <a
href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/07/china-reverts-to-its-dirty-coal-ways/">an
increase in use of coal</a>. Therefore the science-based <a
href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/">‚Äúclimate action
tracker‚Äù ranks China‚Äôs current status as ‚Äúhighly insufficient‚Äù</a>.</p>
<p>This reliance on poor-quality sources is bad journalism, and if that
were all, it would be unremarkable. There are plenty of bad articles
published every day. The problem is that it fuels a narrative about
young people that will only further alienate them.</p>
<p>The olds, like me, have had our fun. We‚Äôve flown where we want,
consumed what we want, and enjoyed the benefits of industrialized
technology. And in doing so we raise a spectre of fear in our young
people, who quite rightly look at the state of the world and wonder if
it can all go on.</p>
<p>Is it right to say that doom is inevitable? I‚Äôm a Buddhist: the
future is uncertain. It‚Äôs a matter of probability, and a reasonable
person must accept that there is a chance that doom is coming within the
lifetime of people alive today.</p>
<p>The chance of the world ending in our lifetimes must be more than
zero, ever since the ‚Äúgreatest generation‚Äù decided to create
world-destroying nuclear arsenals and boomers put them in the hands of
leaders of dubious appetites and unconstrained immorality. The end of
the world is no longer in the sphere of religious fanatics, but of cold
science and mental pathology. The world could end at any moment, and our
only bulwark is our trust that Trump and Putin will do the right thing.
But Trump and Putin are malevolent psychopaths, and they will never do
the right thing.</p>
<p>So if the end of the world must have greater than zero probability,
what is it? 1%? 10%? 80%? What exactly is an acceptable risk? What kind
of probability of the end of the world is sufficient that a reasonable
person would not fall into despair?</p>
<p>How about 0%? Generations have lived under the shadow of the
human-caused annihilation of everything. Have we become so numb to this
abnormality? Is not this numbness itself a sign of mental and moral
pathology? Might despair be a perfectly natural and normal symptom of a
mind that is gaining a sense of moral proportion?</p>
<p>Our moral systems were developed in less urgent times, when a war
meant the death of thousands, and an environmental problem was the loss
of beauty in landscape. Young people are forging a new morality for new
circumstances. We can keep preaching at them as if we have a right to
imagine we have a solution, or we can try listening. Maybe we have
something to learn.</p>
<p>The article quotes from only a few young people. Rather oddly, the
views expressed by the young people, though much fretted-upon, don‚Äôt
really sound problematic if you listen closely. Siddharth Namachivayam,
a college junior in California, remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess, yeah, it‚Äôd be marginally better if Biden was president, but
I don‚Äôt think Biden being president is more important than the Green
party growing in the next couple of years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is arguable, and conventional political wisdom would disagree:
you can vote for Biden and support the Greens Party. But it is the
opinion of someone who is thinking about long-term strategy, not giving
up. Conventional wisdom has brought us to this point, so, regardless of
the merits of this particular stance, looking for long-term systematic
change is a perfectly reasonable response. Rather than condemning him as
a ‚Äúdoomer‚Äù, maybe we could admit that our short-termism is the cause of
the problem, and his longer-term view could be the seeds of something
meaningful? Maybe if we had thought more like him, we would have made
the systematic changes that would have avoided the nightmare we‚Äôre in
today?</p>
<p>Max Bouratoglou, a 19-year-old student in California, has a very
different take on planning for the long-term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôre not seeing people who are planning for the future, because the
future seems so precarious and so unpredictable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly this is reasonable. The amount of chaos in the system is
growing at such a rapid rate that planning for the future is very
problematic. We are in 2020: all of our plans have been thrown out the
window for the whole year. There is no reason to think that the
uncertainty of 2020 is an exception. On the contrary, while there will
be ups and downs, the long-term trend is towards increasing chaos and
uncertainty. What Max is talking about is a reasonable adjustment to the
conditions that he find himself in. If we don‚Äôt like the fact that our
kids think they‚Äôll live in a dystopian future, maybe rather than
complaining about them, we could instead try not creating that
future?</p>
<p>On having children, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considering how nihilistic I feel about the future and how I will be
immediately affected, do I wanna rain that burden upon someone else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we need to ask ourselves what exactly the issue is here. Is
it the folly of the youth? Or perhaps might we ask ourselves, who are we
that created a world that forces young people to think about such
things?</p>
<p>Going forward, no generation will be able to have a child without
facing at least the possibility that the world they will live in is not
what it should be. The articles by Gemma Carey in the Guardian on her <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/26/if-i-have-no-hope-for-the-planet-why-am-i-so-determined-to-have-this-baby">decision
to have a child</a>, and the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/being-pregnant-in-a-climate-emergency-was-an-existential-challenge-miscarriage-has-brought-a-new-grief">subsequent
tragedy amid the Australian bushfires</a>, offer a sensitive and
intelligent reflection on this existential crisis. Young people should
be complaining about homework and not getting dates. They shouldn‚Äôt have
to worry about the end of the world: but they do.</p>
<p>In this, the issue of the most deeply personal decision is
intertwined with the welfare of all. To be clear, population growth is
itself not a major driver of climate collapse, as most population growth
is in underdeveloped countries, where the per-capita carbon output is
minimal. But population growth in California certainly is, since <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/worlds-richest-1-cause-double-co2-emissions-of-poorest-50-says-oxfam">the
richest 1% create over twice the emissions of the poorest 50%</a>. And
to see young people wrestling with these very urgent issues is
essential. It shows that they are seeing their future as interconnected
with the future of the planet. This is not a problem, it is the
solution.</p>
<p>This points to the basic fallacy of Mann‚Äôs critique. There is no
direct line between a belief in the likelihood or otherwise of climate
collapse, and one‚Äôs own actions to try to prevent that or not. Religious
teachers are something of experts in this field, because we‚Äôre been
teaching the whole ‚Äúlove triumphs over hate!‚Äù idea for thousands of
years and, well, here we are. We know all too well that there‚Äôs no
simple relation between beliefs and actions. People who believe a
collapse is likely are diverse, and they do all kinds of different
things. Among that spectrum, it is perfectly reasonable to believe that
(a) collapse is likely, and (b) we should do what we can to stave it off
as long as possible and make it no worse than it need be. It is all
about probabilities and margins.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not as simple as that, sure, and not everyone will respond in
the same way. But so what? Nothing is simple, and there is no field of
human activity where everyone responds the same way. Is there any
empirical proof that the acceptance of probable climate doom is, in
fact, linked to to a long term decline of mental health or of activism?
And if so, is there any evidence that the most effective way to respond
to that is to tell doomers they‚Äôre wrong, rather than engage with their
beliefs in a constructive way?</p>
<p>I would argue that the other side of the equation is vastly more
important. The denial of the reality and the seriousness of climate
collapse creates a psychic split, and that itself manifests in unhealthy
reactions at the psychological and sociological level. In fact, I
believe that the current global rise of authoritarianism and delusional
thinking is an inevitable psychological outcome of climate denialism.
You lock it away, it curdles and comes out worse than before.</p>
<p>One of Jem Bendall‚Äôs points is that we should deeply consider how we
live, and make choices about our lives that lead to both flourishing and
meaning in the present, and the possibility of survival in the case of
collapse.</p>
<p>Bendall also points out that despair is not always bad. It is risky
and unpleasant, to be sure; but in the spiritual path it may be a time
of great uncertainty leading to renewal and transformation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real problem is not the despair of the youth, but the
belief of the adults that ‚Äúwe can fix it‚Äù. This is the quintessential
view of the modernist industrial/technological world. In slower, saner
times, people were more willing to sit and let the seasons ‚Äúturn, turn,
turn‚Äù. Every religion has a place it in for the acceptance of the deep
reality that our power is limited and we cannot change everything.</p>
<p>This is simple common sense, but it goes against the modern myth of
‚Äúempowerment‚Äù. If we tell every child that ‚Äúone person can change the
world‚Äù, are we not forgetting that there are eight billion ‚Äúone persons‚Äù
in this world, and statistics suggest that almost none of them will, in
fact, change the world? And are we so eager to instill the
<em>feeling</em> of power that we forget that those who, history teaches
us, <em>actually</em> have power are, by and large, the ones with the
money, the property, and the guns?</p>
<p>In my day, it was <em>Anarchy in the UK</em> that got the grownups
all fretting about the youth. Pink Floyd got a bunch of kids to turn
over desks and yell, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need no education!‚Äù These days the youth
really have got something to freak out about. Let them. At the very
least, they‚Äôll probably make some cool albums.</p>
