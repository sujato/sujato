<p>In 2019, <a href="2019-05-08-how-to-read-end-world.html">I
wrote a little article</a> about how, when the media talk about climate
change they try to balance things, the good with the bad. But as I
pointed out, too often in such articles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bad things are facts; good things are fantasies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are not getting better. See this recent <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/world-close-to-irreversible-climate-breakdown-warn-major-studies">article
in the Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs full of sober experts from august institutions saying things
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe situation is serious and bleak,‚Äù said Prof Simon Lewis, at
University College London. ‚ÄúShell has made ¬£26bn profit this year,
carbon emissions are back at pre-pandemic levels, while 53,000 people
died of heat stress in Europe in the summer, and floods have displaced
millions from Nigeria to Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bad things are facts.</p>
<p>But on the positive side:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania in the US, said
it was important to note that progress was being made: ‚ÄúMore work
clearly needs to be done if warming is to be kept below 1.5C, but nobody
foresaw the major policy progress in recent months in both Australia and
the US. It is estimated that the US legislation will lower national
emissions by 40% this decade. With US leadership, we can expect other
major emitters to now come to the table at Cop27.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPolicy progress‚Äù, ‚Äúestimated‚Äù, ‚Äúwill lower‚Äù, ‚Äúwe can expect‚Äù, ‚Äúcome
to the table‚Äù.</p>
<p>The good things are fantasies. None of them change anything about
what matters: global atmospheric CO2.</p>

<p>Is this, then, to be our doom?</p>
<p>As the stresses of climate breakdown make themselves felt, the rich
squeeze harder while the poor drown. Fear grows, stoked by the ‚Äústrong
men‚Äù who promise to fix it all. Democracy decays and fascism rises, and
with it its instruments whose names are war, plague, poverty, fire, and
flood.</p>
<p>Fascists have no interest in stopping climate change. They are riding
it to victory, reveling in the chaos. They are weaponizing the
apocalypse.</p>
<p>Do not be distracted. Do not get so caught up in winning battles that
you fail to notice the war. Their most terrible weapon is not guns or
nukes but the movement of people. It is the movement of people that is
the tip of the spear. It is bringing nations to their knees.</p>
<p>They look to the millions of refugees who came out of Syria and they
see how people reacted in Hungary, in Italy, in the UK, and they
salivate. Climate breakdown will bring tens of millions of refugees,
hundreds of millions. In that they see not tragedy but opportunity. They
hunger for more and they set their engineers to the task. The collapse,
not of nations, but of the idea of the nation state, and the return of
rule by the world‚Äôs once and forever kings: big men with guns.</p>
<p>Their dreams are our nightmares. Their victories are ashes and dust.
Their currencies are rape and murder.</p>
<p>For those of us who live in peaceful democracies, we see eroding
rights, creeping illiberalism, and worst of all, the rusting of our
moral compass. We, the polite and pleasant who tick on surveys that we
are ‚Äúsomewhat concerned‚Äù with climate change. We will change the locks
on our doors. We will cower beneath the ruins of hope as we gradually
transform into something else, something loathsome. Until the last
illusion cracks altogether and we are no more than slaves or cannon meat
for oligarchs and thugs and bullies. Until we are the refugees,
wandering lost and homeless over the wilderness, praying that somewhere,
someone will not lock their doors against us.</p>
<p>And then will come the aftertimes, when people look back at the rule
by oligarchs and thugs and bullies and think of it with sentimental
fondness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is this to be our fate?</p>
<p>It is folly to think we can stop climate change. It is our past, our
present, and our future. There is no scenario depicted by the IPCC that
is not vastly worse than what we see today. This, now, our pleasures and
delusions and indulgences, this is what we sow, and so shall we
reap.</p>
<p>Are we then to despair? Do not fear despair. It is a normal, healthy,
and proportional response to the future we have made. If you have not
despaired, don‚Äôt worry, it will come. If you have despaired, you have
already learned that it need not master you. If you are despairing, know
that it is impermanent and you will emerge stronger than ever. It was
not until he knew true despair that Siddhattha set out on his noble
quest.</p>
<p>Do not let them tell you who you are. You are not defined by your
times. Not by your body. Not by your desires. Not by what is expected of
you. Not by how you are treated.</p>
<p>We define ourselves in our actions. We make ourselves in every
choice. We are, now, the person formed by our past choices, and we are,
now, becoming the person formed by our present choices.</p>
<p>This is our kamma.</p>
<p>Do not live under the illusion that you can change the world. Live in
the knowledge that in every moment and every day, you made the best
choice you could, for yourself, for those you love, for the whole world.
Become what you choose. Choose with wisdom, choose with kindness, choose
with love. Live and die knowing that you lived clear-eyed and full of
goodness.</p>
