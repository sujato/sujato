There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a seventh
sun appears. This great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in
one burning mass of fire. And as they blaze and burn the flames are
swept by the wind as far as the BrahmƒÅ realm. Sineru the king of
mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it‚Äôs overcome by the great
fire. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or two,
three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn. Who
would ever imagine that this earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will
burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth?

<p>
As a Buddhist monk, I have practiced to see things as they are. To
accept what is real and true, without rejecting what I do not like or
embracing what I find amenable. I have also meditated for many years on
deep compassion, on seeing the value of all life first and foremost, and
respecting the role of humanity as carers and custodians. My relation
with nature is not that of a farmer or a gatherer, a fisher or a miner.
Although my spiritual life would not be possible without the material
support of those who make use of the land, I don‚Äôt see the earth
primarily as a source of food, income, or resources, but as a source of
wonder and spiritual renewal. And so I have lived in forests for much of
my life in search of peace. Now I live in the city, partly because I
don‚Äôt know that the forest life in Australia has a future. There is a
balance in all things, between the spiritual and the material, the
forest and the city, the life of renunciation and the life of
accumulation, and I fear that balance has been lost.
</p>
<p>
We humans are pretty efficient at filtering out things we don‚Äôt want to
hear. Despite decades of messaging, it‚Äôs still possible to go through
life not know anything much about our climate crisis. Few are really
prepared to change, or <em>for</em> change. I‚Äôve been involved in the
environmental movement in one way or another since the early 1980s, and
it is clear that, whatever our successes in other areas, we have failed
on the big one. The scientists and engineers have done their jobs, but
it hasn‚Äôt translated into the kind of change we need. How do we change
so many people so far so fast, and implement that change in effective
policy? The whole thing is so unprecedented, so vast, we just don‚Äôt know
what will work. And it is sheer naivety to dismiss the possibility that
there simply is no solution; that we are rushing headlong to our own
self-created annihilation and will just keep on going. I don‚Äôt know, and
I doubt anyone else does either. I do believe, though, that whatever
happens, and whatever we do or don‚Äôt do about it, it is better to be
informed than to be ignorant.
</p>
<p>
I am no expert, just a little piece of planet earth that has somehow
managed to become sentient, and who has used some of that sentience to
read about climate change. Over the years I have benefited from articles
that gather up-to-date reports in one handy place. The first and most
impactful for me was
<cite><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/an-introduction-to-global-warming-impacts-hell-and-high-water-b92403b73ee0/2009">An
introduction to global warming impacts: Hell and High Water</a></cite>,
a 2009 article in ThinkProgress by Joe Romm. It‚Äôs ten years old, but
still well worth reading. I thought I‚Äôd do something similar, so I could
learn some more and maybe help some folks get up to speed. Many of these
links were sourced from a scrappy post that went viral during the
Australia bushfires of 2019/2020,
<cite><a href="https://medium.com/@cache_86525/the-future-is-grim-27ca6f7ab07b">The
future is grim</a></cite>. I have tried to favor original sources, but a
well-written media report is often more palatable than a scientific
journal. There are over 350 articles linked here, loosely gathered by
topic, but still it covers only a small portion of the climate news. And
there is a recency bias, as I have focused on news over 2019‚Äìearly 2020.
If you want to keep up with events,
<cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/au/environment">The
Guardian</a></cite> has the best mainstream coverage of the climate
crisis.
</p>
<p>
This is a litany of facts, sprinkled with a little of my own commentary.
Ignore my thoughts if you like, they are not important: the earth is. It
can be quite distressing to learn about the state of our planet, so you
probably want to read in moderation. The sky is still blue (in some
places), there is still water to drink (if you‚Äôre lucky), and the air
can be breathed (on a good day). Whatever the blessings that life gives
you, enjoy them while you can. Mother Earth wants us to be happy. But
she also wants us to, you know, stop shitting on her. So best do that
then.

No survey or summary can do justice to the harms inflicted on our living
planet by human industrial activity. There are too many things, effects
strange and unexpected, local conditions that no-one could have forseen.
One thing we do know above all else: it‚Äôs bad and it‚Äôs getting worse.

I‚Äôm beginning this list with a quote from the U.S. Army War College. I‚Äôm
a life-long pacifist, and this is a nod to the fact that, although the
environment has become a politically polarized issue, reality doesn‚Äôt
care about our politics. Even the institutions most closely associated
with the exertion of power, imbued with the ethos that they can bend
circumstances to their will, must eventually face a reckoning. The U.S.
military, quite apart from its humanitarian record, is one of history‚Äôs
greatest CO‚ÇÇ emitters. Yet they acknowledge that the environment is
something beside which all their guns and bombs are powerless.

Army War College with NASA</a></cite>: ‚Äú<b>Sea level rise, changes in
water and food security, and more frequent extreme weather events are
likely to result in the migration of large segments of the
population.</b> Rising seas will displace tens (if not hundreds) of
millions of people, creating massive, enduring instability. This
migration will be most pronounced in those regions where climate
vulnerability is exacerbated by weak institutions and governance and
underdeveloped civil society. Recent history has shown that mass human
migrations can result in increased propensity for conflict and turmoil
as new populations intermingle with and compete against established
populations. More frequent extreme weather events will also increase
demand for military humanitarian assistance. Salt water intrusion into
coastal areas and changing weather patterns will also compromise or
eliminate fresh water supplies in many parts of the world. A warming
trend will also increase the range of insects that are vectors of
infectious tropical diseases. This, coupled with large scale human
migration from tropical nations, will increase the spread of infectious
disease. Arctic ice will continue to melt in a warming climate. The
increased likelihood is of more intense and longer duration drought in
some areas, accompanied by greater atmospheric heating.‚Äù

The state of the climate
</h3>
<p>
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the details. Don‚Äôt be distracted by the latest
news-of-the-day. The chart that matters is the one below: how much CO‚ÇÇ
is in the atmosphere. It is CO‚ÇÇ that is the primary driver of global
warming, and this one measure‚Äîthe Scripps CO‚ÇÇ program at Maunua Loa,
maintained since 1958‚Äîis both crucially important in itself, and
provides a proxy for the state of play.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs easy to be impressed by reports of new technologies, or a
flatlining of emissions in some sectors. However, emissions are not just
produced by industry or transport or the energy sector, but by melting
tundra and burning forests as well. And they do not exist in a vacuum;
the earth‚Äôs systems are dynamic, and carbon is being absorbed as it is
being emitted. It‚Äôs complicated. Many factors are beyond our control,
and many are subject to little-understood feedback effects.
</p>
<p>
The global atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ reflects all the CO‚ÇÇ put into the atmosphere
from every source, as well as all the CO‚ÇÇ that is removed. And as you
can see, the news isn‚Äôt great: CO‚ÇÇ continues to rise and even
accelerate, the gentle upwards curve belying the idea that somehow we
have it all under control.
</p>
<p>
The world is not ours. It belongs to no person, no nation, no
corporation. It is our conceit telling us we have the right to control
it, and our delusion pretending we have the means to bend it to our
will. When we grok that, we have taken the first step towards wisdom.

Emissions: it‚Äôs not just power, cars, and planes
</h3>
<p>
The basic CO‚ÇÇ equation: emissions grow as absorption declines. Attention
usually focuses on obvious things like energy production and transport,
and while these are important, there are plenty of other sources of
emissions both human and natural. Heavy industry, meat, construction,
and the military all produce vast amounts of CO‚ÇÇ. Meanwhile, natural
sources of CO‚ÇÇ and methane appear dangerously close to irreversible
tipping points, where climate disruption upsets the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
equilibrium, creating massive new surges of greenhouse gases.
</p>
<p>
Preventing climate collapse is a lot harder than just putting up some
solar. The ultimate culprit is our industrialized economy. Setting aside
the details of technology and policy, what industrial society does is
harness the element of fire to transform matter on an unprecedented
scale. So long as we follow this path, we will be forcing nature down a
road she does not want to take. Smarter technologies may allay the
trauma, but without a radical change of values I fear we will simply
face a new crisis a few years down the road.

Current predictions
</h3>
<p>
Prediction is an ancient art. 2,500 years ago, the Buddha spoke of a
time when the waters would rise and drown the lands; of a time when the
heat would grow out of control and nations would be devastated by an
inferno of flame. Not that the Buddha claimed to see the future, but he
understood cause and effect. The conditions that we take as normal are
but a short chapter in the earth‚Äôs long story. The world we know evolved
from complex interactions of nature that include human activity. And if
human activity changes drastically, as it has done in the industrial
era, one chapter may finish and another begin. Whether our story
continues in the next chapter is as yet unclear.
</p>
<p>
Modern predictions are scarcely less dramatic, but considerably more
precise. On the whole, scientific predictions since the 1970s have been
fairly accurate. The IPCC reports are couched in a highly complex
language of conditionality, reminding us that the future is not set in
stone but is determined by the choices we make today. Arrived at via a
painstaking process of consensus, which requires accommodating denialist
governments from Saudi Arabia and Australia, the mainstream science has
proven to be on the whole quite accurate. Meanwhile, some scientists,
such as NASA‚Äôs James Hansen, argue that there is an overall bias towards
conservatism in science, and the real picture is considerably more
severe. Time will tell, I guess, so long as someone is left alive to
read the instruments.

Current response
</h3>
<p>
In a word, inadequate. Nations hold grand meetings at which they
publicly proclaim their determination to fight climate change, while
privately fighting among themselves for who gets to emit the most
carbon. The basic metric is the ‚Äúcarbon budget‚Äù, a reductive term that
reflects how totally our love and reverence for our living planet has
been subsumed by economic rationalism. Increasing your ‚Äúcarbon budget‚Äù
is a win, because you get to emit more, destroy more of the planet, and
make more money. The end result of all this is that nations make
pathetically small, non-binding commitments, then fail to keep them.
</p>
<p>
In traditional Buddhist cultures I have seen how elders are honored with
love as our mothers and fathers. Caring for them is a privilege that can
scarcely begin to repay the debt of gratitude we owe. I wonder what the
international process would look like if, instead of treating our planet
as a resource to be spent, and complaining about the burden of caring
for her, we honored her as our Mother, and took loving care of her with
joy in our hearts.

<p>
Nature is us; we are a part of nature. This truth has been self-evident
to me my entire adult life. But as the wonderful
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/15/my-favourite-film-koyaanisqatsi">Koyaanisqatsi</a>

The animals are dying; except cows, sheep, chickens, and pigs
</h3>
<p>
Humans are animals, and it has become increasingly difficult to point to
a specific biological feature that sets us apart from the rest of the
animal kingdom. One thing indisputably unique about us, however, is our
creation of industrial society and our employment of that to bend nature
to our will. The good news is, not all humans have felt such a
separation from our animal brothers and sisters. I was once told by Ken
Colbung, an aboriginal elder of the Nyoonga people, that he was
vegetarian because his people would never kill an animal unless it was
necessary to survive. Times have changed; for us to survive, it is
necessary not to kill, but to stop killing animals. But it seems most of
us have not got the memo yet.

In the psychology of Carl Jung, the ocean is the great symbol of the
unconscious. And as so often, the metaphors employed by the mind reflect
a much more concrete material reality. We only see the shining surface
of the seas and remain largely ignorant of what happens underneath. Yet
most life lives in the seas, and they will be at the forefront of our
survival or annihilation. Staggering under the multiple impacts of
heating, acidification, pollution, and overfishing, the dread specter of

The future of water: floods and drought
</h3>
<p>
There is no simple way to predict changes in our rainfall and water
supplies. Sometimes dryer, sometimes wetter; but at all times, greater
unpredictability, harsher extremes, and less time to recover or find
balance. That means a harder life for all farmers, for emergency
services, and for all of us who depend on them.
</p>
<p>
In a Singapore apartment one morning, I had the chance to discuss
Singapore‚Äôs climate change response with a senior civil engineer. As
Singapore is a relatively rational society, there is none of the
denialist nonsense to deal with, and lots of ambitious ideas planned or
proposed. The apartment, like many that morning, was flooded after heavy
rains. That wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen, I was told. They were designed
for a hundred year flood, and now it‚Äôs every three or four years. It
highlighted the uncertainty of ambitious engineering plans in an
uncertain future. Raise coastal roads by a meter (but won‚Äôt sea level
will rise more than that?) Build a floating airport (will anyone still
be flying?)
</p>
<p>
The real adaption is not to heat or sea level or fire, but to chaos.

There is nothing more fundamental, nothing we take more for granted,
than the air we breath. Millions of people live in places where this

continue to get worse in the future, air pollution creates chronic,
widespread health effects across the whole population, exacerbating the

Breathing is the foundation of meditation. The breath that enters us
brings life and ease, reminding us that we are still alive. How are we
to sooth our anxieties in meditation when we know, in the back of our
minds, that every breath is filling us with poison?

climate change by affecting the amount of incoming sunlight that is

The planet is on fire

<p>
In January 2020 I returned from the fires of Northern California to the
devastation of eastern Australia. I have seen over the Blue Mountains,
peak after peak, valley after valley, everything black and burned, with
nothing remaining but silence and ashes and death.
</p>

Though I have read the science, I guess I somehow assumed that climate

studiedness to it all. The science sounds so civilized. But fire is not
civilized.

Perhaps we have been looking at it all wrong. The ancient Indo-European
peoples did not study fire as a science, but worshiped it as a God. For
a while, He deigned to help us, to smelt our metals and drive our
industry. But we forgot our prayers and imagined that we had become the
master, bending fire to our will. Fools, the lot of us.

At once one of the most visible signs of altered climate, and one of the

at the forefront of media coverage. The poles are intimately linked with
our lives through multiple mechanisms: plankton, sea currents, weather

only a few short years until the Arctic ice will vanish, changing the
very picture of earth from space, while accelerating warming as the

It is easy to get hold of information about the material effects of our
collapsing ecosystems. But I am a monk, and I wonder about our humanity.
What does it mean for us as human beings, to realize the true enormity
of what we have done? Will we ever be ready to take responsibility for

Food: hunger on the rise again

<p>
There are few sights more heartbreaking than the image of a starving
human being. Living in a developed nation knowing only abundance, it is
in starvation that we see the true meaning of inequality. It‚Äôs such a
fine line between abundance and despair. My home state of Western
Australia grows 50% of Australia‚Äôs wheat in the marginal and arid
wheatbelt east of the Darling Range, where even a small fluctuation in
the weather can spell disaster for the farmers.

The wealthy can afford to buy face masks and air purifiers, to seek
medical aid and treatment when they need it. All these things are denied
to the poor, not to speak of the homeless, relentlessly exposed to the
elements. Yet even the richest, at the end of the day, must breathe the

clean water, pure air, benign sun. Women today are struggling with the
impossible choice of whether to have children in a world facing

their choice. If they survive, what will they be thinking when it comes

Progressives and activists tend to assume the best of people. We like to

changes. And sure, that‚Äôs not all wrong. But it‚Äôs not all right, either.
It‚Äôs also true that when the pressure is on, people close ranks, arm

When I was in Vienna several years ago, it so happened that a former
prime minister of Australia was visiting Europe, touting Australia‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/20/cate-blanchett-on-australias-dislocated-politics-youre-living-in-a-system-thats-gone-mad">vicious</a>

treatment of asylum seekers as an example for the world. What was
interesting for me to see was the support he got from the Nazis. Not the
‚Äúinternet troll‚Äù kind of Nazi, but your actual jackboot-wearing, Mein
Kampf-reading, holocaust-enthusiast Nazis. They thought Australia‚Äôs
asylum seeker policies are great. I take this as a warning: how depraved
the acts of a supposedly civilized nation may become in the face of a
minuscule trickle of poor, brown people on boats.
</p>
<p>
I believe that the movement of people will be the tip of the spear. The
numbers will go from the thousands to the millions, and from the
millions to the hundreds of millions. And no-one has an answer to the
one basic question: where will they all go?
</p>
<p>
The political right has been telling us for years that the movement of
people is an imminent threat to our nation and our way of life. You
can‚Äôt have a nation if you can‚Äôt defend your borders, they say. They‚Äôre
lying, of course. The historical movement of people into developed
countries poses no such threat, and indeed is strongly associated with
economic and cultural growth.
</p>
<p>
Yet there is a point at which the lie becomes the truth. The water runs
dry, the cities break down, and a nation cannot survive. That day may be
mere decades away. As compassionate progressives, our impulse is to
embrace the lost and the disadvantaged in the belief that helping those
in need is both moral and practical. But we are yet to face our day of
reckoning. What are we going to do when the dark fantasies of the right
become our reality? What are we going to do when it is time to open the
doors of <em>our</em> homes? And what karma will we carry when our turn
comes to seek shelter in the home of another?

How did it get so bad?
</h2>
<p>
It‚Äôs not just a failure of public policy or private lifestyle. It‚Äôs a
failure of morality. We have become adept at deflecting responsibility.
Greg Hunt, the former Australian Minister for the Environment and
architect of our failed ‚ÄúDirect Action‚Äù policy, justified his approach
by arguing that if we implemented a carbon tax, China would never follow
suit. Well, I‚Äôm not sure how closely China has modeled its environment
policy after the literal world‚Äôs worst, but my guess is, not much.
</p>
<p>
We‚Äôve become used to such statements. The rich and the powerful, when in
the mood to admit that climate change is real, say there‚Äôs nothing they
can do, as we only make such a small contribution. This line has become
so normal it‚Äôs easy to forget that it is the very definition of
immorality. Our moral life is based on the Golden Rule: do unto others
as you would have them do unto you. It assumes that our good actions
will be mirrored by those we affect. The inaction urged by the right is
the exact opposite: do unto others and make sure they never, ever,
<em>ever</em> do unto you.
</p>
<p>
Climate change disproportionately impacts the poor and the
disadvantaged. For this reason, activists have made the case that action
is an urgent moral necessity. I have come to believe that this strategy
was a mistake. The suffering of the poor is not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature.
The rich built the system, and they built it to externalize the costs of
wealth and power so that someone else has to pay. Preferably someone
poor, brown, and over there.
</p>
<p>
There was a memorable article in my local paper, the <cite>West
Australian</cite>, back in the 80s. For the first time, a big American
motivational speaker came to little old Perth, and inspired thousands
with his message of wealth and ambition. And the last part, he urged, at
the end, when you have your big house and all the things you want, you
need to do one more thing. Get in your new Mercedes and drive back to
the poor suburb you came from. Drive slowly down the streets, and know
to yourself, ‚ÄúI made it, and you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Consider how economics works. Purchasing power is relative, so a
‚Äúdollar‚Äù means nothing but a conventional power to purchase things.
Let‚Äôs say we have a rich man with $100 and a poor woman with $1. The
rich man has 100 times the purchasing power of the poor woman. How is
the rich man to get richer? He can double his purchasing power by
earning another $100. But that‚Äôs hard! You know what‚Äôs easy? Taking 50c
from a poor woman. Now the rich man has $100.50, and the poor woman has
just 50c. The rich man has doubled his purchasing power, and is exactly
as well off as if he‚Äôd made $100 himself. What a win! Of course, this is
an unrealistic scenario. In reality, the richest have not $100, but over
$100,000,000,000, while millions of the poor would think themselves
lucky to have a whole dollar.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs really hard to imagine what that kind of money means, but let‚Äôs
try. For most people, the most significant financial investment they
make is in a home, if they are lucky enough to be able to afford one. In
a wealthy city like Sydney, the median house price is around $1,000,000,
and normally it takes decades of hard work to pay off the loans. Someone
who can actually own their house outright is considered fairly well-off.
It‚Äôs a bit different for the super-rich. Assuming a modest 20% return on
their capital, one of the world‚Äôs richest men could buy a house in
Sydney every twenty minutes for a year, and still end up richer than
they started.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs not just that the rich are greedy. It‚Äôs that wealth only has
meaning when someone else is poor. If everyone was a billionaire, money
would be worthless. And having a beachfront mansion is great, but how
can you really enjoy it if the hoi polloi just waltz on in? Inequality
is not an accidental byproduct of wealth, it is what creates wealth.

When faced with the suffering of the poor and the powerless, do we
really believe the excuses of the rich, that this as a regrettable but
unavoidable fact of the world as it must be? Or is this, rather, the
world that they have built for themselves because they wanted it that
way? Is it possible that the suffering of others is, in fact,

I live by choice in a working-class neighborhood among hard-working
people who happen to be mostly immigrants. Haul a box of tomatoes, dig a
trench, serve a roti. As a monk I have the privilege to be supported by
equally hard-working donors, affording me the time to practice, to
study, to write, and to teach. I get to stand aside and watch as they
get on with their lives. I know that they all just want to be happy, to
make money, to start a family and enjoy life. Nothing wrong with that.
But I also know that none of that will be possible once the climate
collapse starts to bite.

<p>
Even after our apocalyptic summer of fire, nothing much has changed.
There‚Äôs little action on the streets and no revolution in the air.
People have a way of setting aside the long game to focus on the
present. I don‚Äôt know, maybe they‚Äôve got it right.

Governments in denial: public servants serve the corporations

<p>
Growing up in Australia, it‚Äôs traditional to, on the one hand, laugh
about how all politicians are liars and scumbags, while at the same time
be proud of our democracy. That‚Äôs changing. The sense I get today is an
almost total collapse of faith in government and the very idea of public
service. And no wonder. Ten years ago Kevin Rudd, our then Prime
Minister, proclaimed that
<a href="https://theconversation.com/its-ten-years-since-rudds-great-moral-challenge-and-we-have-failed-it-75534">climate
change was ‚Äúthe great moral challenge of our generation‚Äù</a>. He then
proceeded to fail that challenge, massively and systematically. The
Australian government has been particularly terrible, but few are the
governments around the world who have really taken change seriously. We
let our politics be bought by the fossil fuel industry, and they
bargained away our future for the sake of a few miserable coins.

The rich did this and they will leave us to die

plenty of time to contemplate the big picture. Sometimes they decide to
help, so we see the ‚Äúgood billionaires‚Äù make

</p>
<p>
What the rich keep hidden, for the most part, are their escape plans.
When they have ruined the world they aim to live on as immortal lords of
the wasteland.
</p>
<p>
But how much worse is the lifestyle of the rich, really? Let‚Äôs do some
math! The top 1% emit as much carbon as the bottom 50%. According to
<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/carbon-and-inequality-kyoto-paris">Picketty
et al.</a> the global 1% emit about 200 tonnes of greenhouse gases
annually. That‚Äôs a lot! Some studies have produced a
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/40394570/Shift_the_focus_from_the_super-poor_to_the_super-rich">lower
figure</a>, while others are higher. Let‚Äôs take Picketty‚Äôs figure. The
‚Äúcarbon budget‚Äù to stay under 2¬∞C global warming
<a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/CO‚ÇÇ-budget.html">sits
currently at 1,000,000,000,000 tonnes.</a> At current rates it will be
used up in 25 years. If everyone emitted as much CO‚ÇÇ as much as the 1%,
we‚Äôd reach that target in 8 months. If everyone emitted as much as Bill
Gates‚Äî<a href="https://theconversation.com/these-celebrities-cause-10-000-times-more-carbon-emissions-from-flying-than-the-average-person-123886">over
10,000 times as much as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person</a>‚Äîthat 1,600 tonnes per
person would slurp up the budget in less than a month. 2¬∞C heating is a
lot though. If we wanted to keep heating under a more sane (but still
bad) 1.5¬∞C, 8 billion Bill Gates would gobble the world‚Äôs carbon budget
in a week.

The failed promise of carbon policy

We have wasted decades debating the non-topic of whether climate change
is real. We held these conversations in good faith, assuming that those
who denied the science merely needed some sympathy and persuasion. It
seems we were wrong. Meanwhile, the actual topic we should have been
discussing is how to stop it. At its most basic: how can we leave as
much fossil fuel in the ground as possible? But we have hardly even
begun this conversation. Having become accustomed to accepting scraps
from the table, we watch as sane policy is watered down in theory and
drained away in practice.

Systemic breakdown
</h3>
<p>
Everything is interconnected. In spiritual circles, we see this truism
as a positive affirmation grounding our compassion in understanding. But
we tend to forget that the world is not all good, and the bad things are
interconnected, too. Political scientists have begun talking about
‚Äúweaponized interdependence‚Äù. The whole world we know is a dynamic
system of unfathomable complexity. Systems, it is true, have a lot of
built-in resilience. They can adapt to change in remarkable ways. Yet
any system has its limits. Push it too far, too fast, in too many
different ways, and you‚Äôll exceed the limits of adaption. Everything
falls apart.

<p>
This is, I think, the first time in my lifetime that all the world‚Äôs
major powers are in crisis simultaneously: U.S.A., Russia, India (Modi
and Kashmir), China (Hong Kong, coronavirus), E.U. (Brexit, rise of
far-right), Indonesia (unrest). What we have to understand is that this
is not a blip, it‚Äôs not a period of instability or transitional crisis
like the Cold War or the collapse of the Soviet Union. It‚Äôs the
manifestation of multiple, long-term processes, none of which are
turning corners any time soon.

The exhaustion of the earth‚Äôs minerals
</h3>
<p>
Everything that we manufacture comes from somewhere. Everything has a
cost. People seem to think that solar energy or electric cars are ‚Äúgood‚Äù
for the environment. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre actually really bad. The
materials for solar cells have to be mined, transported, processed,
transported again, manufactured, transported again, assembled,
transported again, and installed. When they are running they create heat
and support the purchase of lots of other things that also harm the
environment: lights, TVs, computers, and so on. Then when their life is
over, they must be transported yet again to recycling or landfill, where
they are full of toxic crap. Ditto electric cars.
</p>
<p>
The point is, while they are bad, they are somewhat less bad than the
fossil-fuel alternative. Solar and other renewables (and nuclear) have a
lifetime CO‚ÇÇ impact roughly 10% that of coal (gas is half-way between).
So building electric cars doesn‚Äôt help the environment: taking petrol
cars off the road does. In most cases, rather than fancy high-tech
solutions it‚Äôs far more effective to develop public transport and
pedestrian-friendly cities. But it‚Äôs just not so sexy, is it? No-one

Pollution
</h3>
<p>
Some environmentalists believe pollution to be a bigger crisis than
global warming. Since the skies of England were darkened by coal, or the
rains of Europe became acid, we have lived with the realization that our
environment is not infinite; that if we keep on dumping stuff, it will
have an effect sooner or later. In certain cases we have shown a
willingness to put effort into restoring once-lost
beauty‚Äî<a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151111-how-the-river-thames-was-brought-back-from-the-dead">the
cleanup of the river Thames comes to mind</a>‚Äîbut on the whole the story
pollution tells is of a species all too willing to make a mess and
expect someone else to clean it up.

Nuclear war
</h3>
<p>
Once regarded as the most urgent threat humanity had ever seen, the
threat of nuclear war receded from public consciousnesses with the end
of the cold war. But the nukes remain. And as we teeter into greater
instability and chaos, the likelihood that they will be used is growing.
</p>
<p>
I have a friend who works in nuclear disarmament. We joke that he‚Äôs one
of the few people whose work would be regarded as a success if we stay
alive long enough to be killed by climate change.

<b>The Doomsday Clock is now at ‚Äú100 seconds to midnight.‚Äù</b> Both
nuclear war and catastrophic effects from climate change grew more
dangerous in 2019‚Äîand world leaders made things worse. ‚ÄúThis
situation‚Äîtwo major threats to human civilization, amplified by
sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda‚Äîwould be serious enough
if leaders around the world were focused on managing the danger and
reducing the risk of catastrophe. Instead, over the last two years, we
have seen influential leaders denigrate and discard the most effective
methods for addressing complex threats‚Äîinternational agreements with
strong verification regimes‚Äîin favor of their own narrow interests and
domestic political gain.‚Äù

<h2 id="what-are-we-to-do">
What are we to do?
</h2>
<p>
You know, of course. You have known all along. But sometimes it‚Äôs nice
to be reminded, so here are some tips.
</p>
<ul class="loose-list">
<li>
Do what you can because it is the right thing to do. Don‚Äôt worry too
much about outcomes. Be content with what you have, finding joy in love
of self and others.
</li>
<li>
Give away everything you don‚Äôt need, because soon you won‚Äôt be able to
keep even the things you do need.
</li>
<li>
Live a good life, for one day soon there will come a reckoning. And on
that day, what kind of person do you want to be?
</li>
<li>
Meditate until you touch that place of peace inside yourself. They can‚Äôt
take that away from you.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/">Read the words of the Buddha</a>. He
taught about suffering and impermanence. And he showed that only in full
awareness of that fact is it possible to be free.
</li>
<li>
Change the world, not because you know what‚Äôs best for everyone else,
but because you are the world and the world is in you. Gang up with
like-minded people and cause some trouble. Why the heck not?
</li>
<li>
Don‚Äôt fear the truth. Grief, despair, anger, and hopelessness are part
of your journey. They don‚Äôt make you a bad person, they make you a
person.
</li>
<li>
If you expect things to get better in the future, you may be right! But
I‚Äôll be honest, it seems unlikely at this point. So: work for better
world, and prepare for a worse.
</li>
<li>
Buy green. Or better yet, don‚Äôt buy anything at all.
</li>
<li>
Vote for the environment while you still have a vote.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And finally, don‚Äôt trust anyone who‚Äôs touting some new and shiny
solution. The wisdom we need is as old as the hills, as rich as the
forests, and as deep as the ocean.
</p>
<p>
The solution is simplicity itself.
