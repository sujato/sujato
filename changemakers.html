<p>This is how it goes.</p>
<p>You ask nicely, they say “No.”</p>
<p>You ask nicely, they say “No.”</p>
<p>You ask nicely, they say “No.”</p>
<p>You insist, they say “Well okay. But you should have asked
nicely.”</p>
<p>I’ve always been someone who feels an inner drive to stand up for
what is right. It’s who I am. I don’t feel like it is a particularly
virtuous way to be, it just feels normal. I can’t imagine not being like
this. It’s not like I am some major activist or anything, but part of my
life has always been to try to stop Bad Things from happening.</p>
<p>There’s been successes and failures. I made some small contributions
to supporting bhikkhuni ordination and the equality of women in the
Sangha. That’s very much a work in progress, but we have taken some
major steps forward, even though we were attacked and undermined at
every turn. More recently I helped galvanize a movement to stop the
fraudulent sale of original poetry masquerading as ancient Buddhist
scripture. I’m super-proud of these things! It’s important to remember
the good things that you have achieved, and remind yourself that in some
small way, you have made a difference.</p>
<p>Other things didn’t work out so well. In the 80s especially, I did a
lot of work with Animal Liberation. We never really succeeded in our
main thrust, which was to eliminate the awful industry of factory
farming, and make clear the inexcusable ethical consequences of eating
meat. There’s more awareness now, some legislative changes, some shift
in the zeitgeist. But factory farming continues to grow unabated, with
all its associated horrors of animal abuse and environmental
destruction.</p>
<p>Even worse is the case of climate change, where decades of activism
have utterly failed to slow the accelerating rise of global atmospheric
CO2, which as I write sits at <s>417.82 ppm</s> 418.56 ppm. Sorry, I had
to revise it upwards while I was writing. The last time it was this high
was 3.6 million years ago, when the sea level was 24 m higher than
today, and the temperature 3.8°C higher. I’ll be at the next rally, but
I doubt it’ll do any more than the last one.</p>
<p>It’s a lonely and weird world. You stand in protests with a dozen
people, make statements and write letters, and it’s pretty awkward
actually. I never feel like it’s something I enjoy or that I want to do.
I hate conflict. But I just hate injustice more. I’ll be doing it till I
die: it’s part of who I am.</p>
<p>And so after a long time, you learn to recognize the patterns. The
people who created the problem refuse to do anything about it. It’s tied
too deeply to their own self-identity. So you gradually escalate the
pressure until, if it works, you eventually push them to change it. Then
they turn around and start explaining how <em>you</em> were the problem
all along, that if only you’d gone about it the <em>right</em> way it
would have been fine. As if they have the moral authority to lecture you
about the <em>right way</em> to bring about change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bystanders chip in and say, “Well, I always believed in
what was right, but you see, I didn’t like the <em>way</em> it was
done.” Well, with all due respect, perhaps you might consider sitting
down now, just like you did then. We needed you and you weren’t there
for us. You don’t get to tell us the way it should have been. Being a
bystander is the easiest thing in the world. That’s why most of us do it
most of the time. Standing up to be counted: that’s what takes guts.</p>
<p>This little article is for the changemakers. I want you to know: it’s
not you. You don’t have to be lectured by the ones who created the
problem, or who sat by and judged you while you tried to fix it. It’s
not your job to learn and grow from the experience—it’s theirs. You’ve
already learned and grown, that’s why you had the moral compass to
recognize the Bad Thing for what it was.</p>
<p>We all know what it’s like. The tension, the uncertainty. Maybe
you’ve been trembling, or feeling out of place and alienated. Maybe
you’ve been physically or verbally abused and attacked, subject to all
kinds of accusations and innuendoes. Some of you, I know, are not here
any longer, because they killed you. Or they traumatized you so much you
just got out of the game altogether—it’s too much. Maybe not, though, I
dunno, maybe you’ve been just fine! But I think that for most of us
there is a cost. I want to talk about that, to talk about the ways that
the Doers of the Bad Thing shift blame onto those who try to stop them.
When we make these things conscious we can be forewarned and
prepared.</p>
<p>Pheeewwww …. Just breathe. It can be triggering, I know. It is for
me. Take a moment, gather your mindfulness. Remember what it is that
we’re here for.</p>
<p>The last thing the changemakers need is a lecture. At each step of
the way, with each new argument and shift in perspective, we’re
agonizing and self-doubting. We have headaches and churning guts and
sleepless nights. We look for lame excuses not to go, or to do anything
else. We waste endless hours of our precious life worrying about some
miserable pointless rubbish that should never have been a thing in the
first place. This is an emotional cost created by the Doers of the Bad
Thing and paid by us.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I just want to say to the changemakers: I see
you. I understand. I know how hard it is. I know that you just want to
do what is right and get on with your life. I know that the last thing
you need is someone second-guessing and undermining what matters to you,
especially not someone who <em>is</em> the problem. We do plenty of
self-doubting already. It’s when we overcame those self-doubts that we
found the courage to stand up. But there are those who want nothing more
than for us to sit down, and they know how easy it is to plant the seeds
of doubt.</p>
<p>It’s called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith">bad
faith</a>”, and it’s how they’ll undermine the possibility of change.
Let’s look at some of the patterns.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious one is that they’ll shift attention from
content to manner; from the <em>fact</em> of the Bad Thing to the
<em>way</em> the event unfolded. This is more than mere distraction or
even moral hubris. It is a systematic attempt to undermine the
possibility of change. All the things they’ll criticize you for are
normal things that are necessary to create change, but they’ll frame it
so as to make them appear bad and nasty.</p>
<p>It starts when you say that the Bad Thing is, in fact, a Bad Thing.
Suddenly the Doer of the Bad Thing ascribes to an elevated morality,
where seeing things as “bad” is crude, black-and-white thinking. Even
the most anodyne ethical observation can be undermined in this way.
“Black lives matter!” It seems pretty obvious. But they’ll say, “Oh
honey, don’t <em>all</em> lives matter?”</p>
<p>The very act of making a moral judgment is itself framed as a Bad
Thing. You’ll be called “righteous”, “judgmental”, “narrow-minded”. Your
one-sided morality is beneath their elevated both-sides-ism. Make no
mistake: this isn’t an argument about being morally judgmental, it’s an
argument against having morality at all.</p>
<p>Of course we’re not children. We understand that in some cases, there
really are two sides and there is no clear black-and-white. But not in
<em>this</em> case: <em>this</em> really is black-and-white, that’s why
we took a stand. But for them, any issue must be always both-sides. Or
to be more accurate, any issue where they are on the wrong side. They’re
more than happy to invoke black-and-white moral judgments when it suits
them. After all, is not the dismissal of moral judgment itself the most
intolerant of moral judgments?</p>
<p>This is an effective technique, because it relies on the fact that
most people don’t have training or clarity when it comes to making
ethical decisions. We’re not taught how to do it rationally. So when we
hear these things, we wonder, “Is that right? Am I just pushing my own
view? What if <em>I’m</em> the bad guy?” And all these doubts add up,
they sap our energy and our resolve. With each bad faith question, some
supporters will drop off and disappear, and it gets harder for those who
remain.</p>
<p>And God forbid if anyone dares to be witty, or playful, or bluntly
honest, or if there’s any snark or sarcasm, or a pointed observation, or
a generalization, or if someone speaks in the heat of the moment, or
indeed if anyone at all makes a passing remark that is not fully
qualified and hedged with exceptions. Because as we all know, it is
through the rigorous composition, not to say careful and meticulous
scrutiny and review, of each sentence, ensuring that every word is
certified by a series of committees made up of a balanced board of
members representing all possible points of view, that a message hits
home. So you get rid of anything resembling humanity. And your message
is met with a polite smile and a cucumber sandwich. But at least you’ve
succeeded in what really matters, which is to not annoy the Doers of the
Bad Thing.</p>
<p>Except no actually. Now they criticize you for being inauthentic.
It’s almost as if you can’t win. It’s almost as if that was the point
all along. So all the time and effort you put in to craft things
carefully, to understand the issues, to communicate and support each
other; all that wholesome and productive work is ignored, brushed aside,
because someone somewhere said something that someone decided to make an
issue out of. It’s frustrating.</p>
<p>And so we need to keep reminding ourselves: it’s not you. Just do
your best. You don’t have to be perfect. You will be criticized no
matter what you do. So don’t worry about what they say. Just do what you
know to be right. Don’t buy into their outrage. Let them deal with their
own karma.</p>
<p>Let’s say you ignore the injunctions to not have any moral compass
and to not talk like a human being. You actually get people on your side
to stop the Bad Thing. Now it’s a “mob”. It’s the baying hounds. It’s a
pack out for blood. Of course, the Doers of the Bad Thing have already
had many opportunities to stop. They have been asked politely, many
times. Not that they should need to be asked; the Bad Thing should never
have happened in the first place. Seriously, most of the evil in the
world is this puddle of miserable, pathetic little self-serving lies
deserving of no-one’s time or attention. Yet here we are. And they won’t
stop. That’s why we need to organize.</p>
<p>For you, the fact that other people also recognize the Bad Thing
comes as a relief and a solace. You’re not crazy! You need this, you
need a sense of belonging. You have found your people. Those who stand
alone, like Greta Thunberg in her early school strikes, bear a huge
weight; no-one can do that for long. Bringing people together to stop a
Bad Thing is intrinsically a Good Thing. You should be proud to be a
part of it, to stand beside others, to recognize that we, as human
beings, still have the capacity to join together for no other reason
than to do good.</p>
<p>But when you focus the group energies and the core message, they’ll
accuse you of creating an “echo chamber”, enforcing ideological
conformity. You’re all just sheep, incapable of an independent opinion,
manipulated by ideological masters. If you’re really lucky, they’ll come
onto your platform to accuse you of living in an echo chamber. Like the
guy who wrote a book about being silenced by big tech and sold it on
Amazon, or the talking heads on Fox News whining about being cancelled
by the media, irony is not their strong suit.</p>
<p>They want you to forget that the Doers of the Bad Thing have their
own group, their own “echo chamber” who saw what they were doing, who
reinforced it, who failed to speak out when they had doubts, who were
swept up in the group dynamic. Usually you don’t know about that because
they keep it deliberately hidden. It’s only <em>public</em> discourse
that gets accused of being an echo chamber.</p>
<p>Any group needs a unifying message. There needs to be a simple and
clear call. At a protest, someone will stand at the front and yell a
slogan. That doesn’t mean they only know slogans, it means they
understand how group dynamics work. Without unity it is impossible to
create change. And that’s why they want to undermine it.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have to respect everyone’s voice, and
understand that people within a group have autonomy and beliefs and
reason, and a need and a right to express that. A movement needs more
than slogans; it needs depth and diversity and nuance; it needs analysis
that delves into exactly why the Bad Thing is a Bad Thing, and shows
unexpected consequences and ramifications. Now your movement is an out
of control, anarchic mess, with loose cannons and scattershot messaging.
Doers of the Bad Thing will tut tut as they sip their Earl Grey, sighing
as they wonder, “What even is it that those people are trying to
say?”</p>
<p>Once you have a defined group that can act effectively, you commit
the final and gravest of sins: causing disharmony. The world was
peaceful and nice until you lot showed up and started making noise.
Shame on you! Ruining the neighborhood like that. We should all be nice
together and not argue.</p>
<p>This one carries an especially potent emotional charge, for the
reasons made plain on the battlefield of the Kuru land in the Bhagavad
Gita. Those over there, the ones we are about to fight: they are your
brothers, your cousins, your friends. People you like and respect.
People you would, in different circumstances, be happy to sit and have a
nice chat with.</p>
<p>As bad faith arguments go, this is a particularly obvious one, but no
less effective for that. Most people, including those fighting for
change, are conflict avoidant. It’s yucky. You’d rather be doing
anything else. You want to try to minimize any overt conflict, and are
always trying to find that impossible balance between action that is
direct and effective, yet does not spiral out of control. No-one knows
how to do this, we just do our best. Sometimes you go too far, say
something you later regret. That’s okay, move on, it happens. Try better
next time.</p>
<p>It’s odd to see this argument raised so often in Buddhism, because
the Buddha was really clear about what harmony meant for him: “There is
no fellowship with fools.” If people insist on doing a Bad Thing, one
should avoid them at all costs. If you can’t persuade them or stop them,
at least you can avoid being entangled with them.</p>
<p>To misrepresent the Buddha’s teachings, presenting what is not Dhamma
as Dhamma, is one of the most divisive things that a Buddhist can do.
According to the Theravada Dīpavaṁsa, it was this that led to the first
schism between the Mahāsaṅghika and the ancestral Theravādins. The
Mahāsaṅghikas created new scriptures or altered old ones, distorting the
Buddha’s message. When they wouldn’t give them up, the Theravādins made
the choice to go their own way. Regardless of whether this account is
historically accurate, it tells us how important these questions were to
ancient Buddhists. It’s not ideal for anyone, but sometimes it’s the
least bad option.</p>
<p>We’re all good people until we do a Bad Thing. That’s when we see a
person’s quality. When a person is confronted with the reality of the
Bad Thing they did, they have arrived at a fork in the road. On the
right is a broad path worn smooth by many feet, the easy road of denial.
On the left, the narrow and rocky track of redemption.</p>
<p>We carry inside ourselves the impression, or rather the fundamental
psychological architecture, that we are basically a Good Person. And a
thing done by a Good Person must be a Good Thing. This is why it’s so
confusing when people start saying, “Well no not really, it’s actually a
Bad Thing.” It’s cognitively hard to process.</p>
<p>Now, if it’s a small or passing thing, never mind. You can get over
it and see the problem.</p>
<p>But if it is something that is deeply entwined in your sense of self,
something that defines who you are and what matters to you, then the ego
can’t process the co-existence of the two ideas: “I am a Good Person”
and “I did a Bad Thing.” So they need to get the other side to see it as
they do: not as an act that is harmful and has harmful consequences, but
as an expression of an intrinsically pure heart. This is exactly back to
front. We form our character through how we act, not the other way
around.</p>
<p>You can see the moment when this psychological defense kicks in. When
confronted with facts, they’ll sidestep them and call on their own
subjective authority. “Believe me.” “Trust me.” “My intentions were
always pure.” This is the tell. When someone says this, they are getting
desperate, tacitly admitting that the facts are not on their side. They
are telling you they have taken the right hand road.</p>
<p>Be alert, as one of their last-ditch defenses is to make a surface
apology. They will do the bare minimum, relying on the fact that we are
tired of the whole miserable affair and just want to get on with our
lives. We’ll readily settle for what seems to be a concession, make
excuses for all the bad behavior, and move on. Meanwhile, before you
know it, there’s a new attempt to rewrite history and rehabilitate the
Bad Thing. It wasn’t all <em>that</em> bad, actually. There were, after
all, <em>very fine people on both sides</em>. If the matter isn’t fully
laid to rest with finality and completeness, it will rise from its grave
and stalk you like a zombie.</p>
<p>It’s such a shame, for redemption is not as hard as it seems.</p>
<p>The Buddha laid down clear guidelines for someone at this point.
First they need to clearly and explicitly confess what they did. Not in
general terms, but laying out the details and showing that they truly
understand what they did and why it is wrong. Then they need to
whole-heartedly accept responsibility. They may not blame others or
criticize those who have called their bad deeds to light. Nor is it
their place to make excuses or minimize their deeds or rewrite history.
It is up to them to accept whatever consequences arise from their
choices. They should, indeed, invite their peers, the ones who they let
down, to lay down appropriate means of rehabilitation for them. They
should express gratitude for the people who have helped free them from
their mistake. Finally they need to pledge explicitly that they will not
do the same thing in the future.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most beautiful thing in the human heart. We have
within ourselves the capacity for change and redemption. And when we,
the ones who have fought for what is right, see someone come over to our
side, it makes us so happy. We bear no grudge for the pain and anguish
we have suffered, because we understand that we are all deluded; one
day, we were faced with that same choice and we will again. The reality
is as it always has been: we’re not a pack of baying hounds out for
blood. We’re people trying to stop a Bad Thing.</p>
<p>When the Doer of the Bad Thing accepts what they’ve done and truly
understands it, they magically become the Doer of the Good Thing. I feel
warm and happy inside just thinking about that! Welcome home my friend,
my brother, my sister. Here, come sit beside us. We have been here for
you all along. We never hated you, we just wanted you to stop hurting
yourself and others. Be at peace, for there is no evil, no wrong, no
malice in the world that can withstand the power of love.</p>
