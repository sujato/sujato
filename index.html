			<p>Hi, my name is Sujato. I’m a Buddhist monk (or “<i>bhikkhu</i>”). For a while I have been writing and speaking on various matters more-or-less associated with Buddhism. Here I bring it all together as best I can.</p>
					<p>I tend to write things that I don’t talk about. If you’re looking for meditation teachings or teachings on Buddhism, <a href='https://lokanta.live/'>check out my recorded talks</a>, or better, <a href='https://lokanta.github.io/'>join our community in person or online</a>. If you’re looking for technical discussions of Pali, or sci-fi novels, or critiques of AI, or discussions related to global warming, you’re in the right place. </p>

				<p>When the world falls apart, does anything stay in place? What if the survivors were those who have already lost everything? This is a story about life at the end of the world in Parramatta. It is a fairy tale of apocalypse, a cli-fi novel of despair and enlightenment for the reasonably hopeless.</p>

			<h3>escalating global chaos aka climate change</h3>
			<p>As the world ends, what is left for us to do but to do the right thing? The Buddha taught that all things are in a constant state of change; that the climate is no exception, as it too changes over time; and that climate change is driven by human greed. He also taught us the solution—contentment and renunciation. Yet, even though millions of people live lives of contentment and simplicity, to those in power it is unthinkable. It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of consumerism. </p>

			<p>AI plagiarizes the meaningful work of humans, grinds it into paste, and extrudes it as a probabilistically-determined stream of data. It has no inner life and hence no meaning. It is bad at most things. We'd be better off without it. </p>
